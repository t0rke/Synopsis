14:31:13 So, we will get started in just a couple minutes guys and girls.
14:32:26 try to hide all these windows so you don't see as much junk on your screen.
14:32:43 Oh, I can just see that so we know where my brain needs to go. Perfect.
14:32:47 Alright gang. Okay, welcome back.
14:32:51 What do we have the fifth week.
14:32:56 Just keep trucking along.
14:33:00 So just as a reminder, I think a lot of the groups have uploaded their pictures for the sample size if you haven't done that with your captions please do so.
14:33:09 I think there might have been some strange language in the canvas instructions that asks you for some things but your photos and the captions are, that's fine.
14:33:21 We don't need to shop Jeff question.
14:33:37 I'm having a hard time here today I guess so.
14:33:42 Any questions about that before we get going.
14:33:46 Hopefully everybody got a chance to visit some of the sites or talk to the group members who visited some of the sites and it was a nice weekend so wasn't too bad.
14:33:56 So we're going to continue our discussion of water infrastructure today if you have a couple of guest speakers that have graciously agreed to come and chat with you all are.
14:34:05 Jen Lawson, she is the water resources manager for the city of Ann Arbor for the almost 10 years now. Hard to believe and Jen has a background in land use and environmental planning, and she also got her master's in landscape architecture from university
14:34:32 Michigan so Michigan connection. And we also have Sarah page with us Sarah is the drinking water quality manager for the city of environment, just over two and a half years, or turn right around there.
14:34:41 And Sarah has a PhD in environmental and aquatic chemistry from the University of Minnesota, and she has studied a bunch of different stuff including our global blooms in Lake Erie, and also done some consulting work on emerging contaminants.
14:34:57 So, these are lots of questions that's come up from the group so they'll have plenty of good questions for you as I'm sure. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jen and she's going to give us a little overview of the water system.
14:35:12 Oh,
14:35:15 it's hiding.
14:35:34 So do a sound check. Good. Yes, nod your notes. Okay, thank you guys.
14:35:39 Well thank you for that wonderful introduction.
14:35:41 My role at the city of Ann Arbor is very cross departmental and I have up here on the screen water systems and in Arbor.
14:35:50 But it's drinking water. It's stormwater it's sanitary sewage and it's the natural river that runs through the city of Ann Arbor, or here on River. There's a lot of interconnection with those waters.
14:36:03 And that's kind of the role as the city municipality has to play, but there's a few other players that are also going to be listed.
14:36:11 I'm going to talk more about the, the infrastructure, the pipes, the things you can kind of see or the things that are underground. Sarah is going to come in and talk about how we use the water how we make the water and then more of those as as Jason
14:36:25 mentioned the emerging contaminants the issues that we have to deal with, with water distribution.
14:36:39 So much technology.
14:36:41 There we go.
14:36:42 So the city of Ann Arbor is very fortunate to have one of the leading stormwater programs in the entire Great Lakes region, not just in stormwater management, but in green infrastructure bioengineering and utilizing stormwater more as an amenity, as opposed
14:36:57 to just kind of putting into pipe in getting rid of it.
14:37:01 Many times.
14:37:08 Many times when people look at the city of Ann Arbor they think of the city of Ann Arbor with its freeways, the major roads kind of going through some people maybe think about the river flowing through it.
14:37:23 But I think about it this way I think about it with not just the river, but all of those creeks and tributaries that flow through and collect all of the stormwater runoff from our community, going a step further, we have several Creek sheds in the city
14:37:38 of Ann Arbor that we focus a lot of our efforts on.
14:37:42 And I had alluded a little bit to different jurisdictions, some of these Creek sheds are actually what are called county drainage districts, which means the county water source Commissioner's Office also has a say in how to maintain or and or manage those
14:37:56 screenshots.
14:37:58 So specifically in the city of Ann Arbor we have Allen Creek, which is under downtown, it's over 50% impervious, and if you think about all the buildings and streets and all the roads that you see in downtown Ann Arbor.
14:38:10 That's half of the range is going right to the river without any treatment.
14:38:25 You have Malik's Creek on the southern end of town that's the largest Creek shed in town, it's about 40% of the land area, and it's about 40% impervious again. So there's a lot of rain water that falls that goes directly to the river, without any treatment
14:38:32 Traver Creek and honey Creek and swift run creating are also county drains, so they have established county drain districts and there's a multiple jurisdictional management, the ones that are a little bit unique Miller's Creek is not the county drain
14:39:00 does however collect a lot of campus, kind of North nearside campus as well as the default NCR and CRCVNCRV. You'll find their property.
14:39:02 And then Fleming Creek is not a county drain either.
14:39:06 But when it comes to management of who owns those creeks waterways pipes underground. The city of Ann Arbor owns a majority of them sitting in over actually owns all of the green ones showing up on the screen.
14:39:18 interspersed with those are the bright blue ones in the middle, the University actually owns their own stormwater collection system as well depositing directly into the here on River.
14:39:29 The red lines are the county drain so those are the actual established channels for each of those county drains. And then there's a few interspersed purple ones and yellow ones.
14:39:39 Those are privately owned not under our jurisdiction they're actually enter jurisdiction of the state of Michigan.
14:39:47 When it comes to pipes underground though there's a lot of really interesting facts. Some people don't really think about the pipes underground and that's what I get to do every day.
14:39:57 The city's stormwater has a majority of the system that was built before the Vietnam War. In fact, 20% was even installed before the Korean War. We have some pipes and ground that were that are over 120 years old.
14:40:13 That doesn't mean they're bad.
14:40:16 That just means that they're old pipes and infrastructure were built a very differently, 100 years ago, They were much thicker, the user different hiring process.
14:40:26 But that does mean that we kind of have to think a little bit about the longevity of pipes. How well is a pipe built and how long is it going to last.
14:40:35 So, this table is telling me that we have 231 miles of pipes of storm water pipes in the city of Ann Arbor.
14:40:44 That's not including all of the open channels, and the drains and the creeks and the ditches, because those all also can be stormwater as well, if you include all of those numbers were responsible for 541 miles of pipe.
14:41:03 I'm thinking about that 231 number though, if you had a kayak in the city of Ann Arbor, just basically on Creek area.
14:41:11 And you kind of hacked in a pie plate end to end to end, you could get almost all the way to the city of Chicago, just in our storm water pipes.
14:41:21 We have four guys in our public works department that manage all of those pipes.
14:41:29 Not enough guys, we'd love to have a few more.
14:41:32 But that's a lot of pipe that we have to maintain maintain and manage, and that's just the stormwater system I haven't even talked about the other systems.
14:41:42 So the city man Arbor has a separate storm sewer system. It's not unique in the city, or the state of Michigan. However, we are very fortunate that it is separate.
14:41:52 That means that our sanitary sewage does not commingle like city of Detroit for example or some of your larger urban communities. They have what's called commingling within the pipe.
14:42:02 That also means that all of their rainwater goes through a treatment facility, before it gets dumped into the river. We don't have that in Ann Arbor. Every drop of rain that falls and goes into the storm drain goes directly to the Huron River, or it goes
14:42:17 through a detention base in or goes through a rain Gardner goes through a bio swale, none of the rain water that falls is sent to the treatment plant.
14:42:28 But I'm going to switch gears now.
14:42:31 This is the sanitary sewer.
14:42:34 We talked about rainwater, let's put, put a pin in that.
14:42:38 This is what I lovingly call the pool water, and you're talking to toddlers, you can make it fun.
14:42:44 This is an example of actually a grease clog in the sanitary sewer system.
14:42:50 This is grease and roots and all other sorts of things that you flush down the toilet you flush down your disposal in your sink.
14:43:00 This is what ends up in the sanitary sewer system.
14:43:02 We have 362 miles of sanitary pipe.
14:43:08 It's more pipe than stormwater, it's still a lot of pipes that we do have to maintain and manage. Much of that pipe also is hundred years old 50 years old.
14:43:20 We're not installing a whole lot of new sanitary pipe because the majority of our pipe was installed. When an arbor grew postwar 1940s 1950s and 1960s.
14:43:32 They were managing that older pipe as well.
14:43:37 All of that sanitary sewer goes to our wastewater treatment plants. This is on the downstream end of Ann Arbor opposite Sarah, who's at the upstream end of an arbor.
14:43:48 This is where all of the sanitary sewage is treated, and then discharge back into the here on River.
14:43:59 Drinking water is another system that I had mentioned, this is the drink yes is actually on Madison I believe this is installation of new drinking water main that was being installed probably four or five years ago looking at the guys that are in the
14:44:13 picture.
14:44:16 But this is what happens when you don't take care of some of those pipes underground.
14:44:22 There could be catastrophic incidents.
14:44:26 This is actually a park in the city of Ann Arbor that was completely destroyed by a water main break.
14:44:32 And it was a pipe that went directly underground that we know is there, but sometimes things happen there's free saw there's there's pressure, there's hydraulic jumps.
14:44:42 Oftentimes you see this out in the field.
14:44:45 These guys actually are walk, working on a water main break, but it's the same yellow truck it's the same Public Works guys all of our guys are cross trained and so they can work on any of those utility infrastructure projects at any time.
14:44:57 So if there's a massive water main break, we can send all of our crews out there.
14:45:02 If you see them please say hello, thank you goes a long way. Just saying.
14:45:09 What's really important though when we think about drinking water in the city of Ann Arbor, is that it provides a part of the community and the culture Zingerman's uses it for stuff at their deli many of our beer breweries use it.
14:45:22 We use it for medical research we use it, the University uses it for laboratory. And it also provides all of the water for football games. There's a big drastic jump on football Saturday's, when we look at water usage in town.
14:45:36 There's a lot of water that goes into maintenance of that stadium as well.
14:45:44 We can talk about numbers a little bit, I told you guys I kind of look at the numbers in the data behind things are drinking water mains again this is the distribution system this is not all of the smaller little pipes to that go to hydrants and that
14:45:55 kind of thing.
14:45:56 But we have roughly four I'm sorry 530 540, miles of drinking water distribution fight.
14:46:06 That's all of the red that you see what's not included in this map is the university, whose University also has a drinking water distribution system that they maintain and manage and it does is connected to our system.
14:46:21 Another way that's really fun to look at the data is looking at installation dates.
14:46:27 If you look at the very center of the downtown area.
14:46:31 It was installed in the 1880s to the eight to about 1900.
14:46:38 Again, many of those pipes are over 100 years old, but that doesn't mean that it's bad, because pipes were made differently, they were made thicker.
14:46:48 We don't have as many problems on the older pipes, as we do on more of the pipes again in the 1940s 1960s metal was expensive, and it was very.
14:47:00 It was more about let's build the city as opposed to let's take our time.
14:47:04 So as you look out kind of in this ring around town, the green light green the light blue is what we saw basically from 1942 1980
14:47:17 A majority of our system is in the 1960s for installation.
14:47:23 What's interesting about water distribution specifically drinking water distribution system is that there are different materials used, which you see much more of a difference than those other utilities I mentioned before 1920s it was solid cast iron.
14:47:39 And then post war cast iron changed because all of that iron that was used for World War Two.
14:47:48 They were looking for cheaper ways of manufacturing. I mentioned the pipe with the pipe. I'm sorry the thickness got smaller. After the war, they didn't use as much iron in their pipes.
14:48:03 Then we switched to concrete pipes we switch to ductile iron pipe.
14:48:22 thinking long term though, so I mentioned the storm water system I mentioned the sanitary sewer system I mentioned the drinking water system.
14:48:30 We also have to manage this at the city of Ann Arbor. That's where we come in. So the group that I work in as the systems planning unit, and its engineers and scientists that are collaborative and holistic in their planning.
14:48:43 So it's not your typical planning department it's not your typical engineering department.
14:48:48 We're a group of people who look at the entire system using data using framework models using GIS geospatial information, as well as public engagement, and that when you think about it from a scientific standpoint doesn't sound as exciting, but so much
14:49:06 of the communities that you work with.
14:49:10 They think a lot about how their water tastes. What's the pressure of the water coming out of their faucet is the water clean enough to go fishing swimming kayaking boating, and especially in Ann Arbor, they're very engaged very engaged in community issues.
14:49:28 But you see this so much in some of your larger communities.
14:49:33 So thinking about data, we have instantaneous USGS stream gauges, that are around town minute much, much of this data is available online off of the city's website and so it's all publicly available data we don't charge for it.
14:49:50 We pay for the data collection. And then we make it available to whoever wants it, so we can at any given time see how fast the rivers flowing how fast our creeks for flowing.
14:50:01 What's the discharge rate.
14:50:04 Several of them look at dissolved oxygen several of these meters look at the ability to measure us.
14:50:11 We also have rain gauges around town that are 15 minute tipping buckets. So it's exactly what it sounds like it's a little tiny bucket in five different locations including on top of City Hall, that every 15 minutes it dumps.
14:50:24 And we measure how much water was in that bucket. and we can pinpoint, we can look at entire days, weeks, months, or we can see how intense a storm was or what the duration of a specific storm was because we recognize that the rain does not follow the
14:50:40 same in the city of Ann Arbor, sometimes you get a ton of rain on the north side and no rain on the south side. Sometimes all the rain stops at the west side and it's completely dry on the east side, but we don't know that when you listen to CHANNEL SEVEN
14:50:54 or Channel Four and they say oh everyone got an inch of rain.
14:50:58 We recognize that that's not true and that's not how science works. So we have these gauge systems around the city. Again, this is all available online for the city's website.
14:51:09 We've been doing a lot of comparisons with flow monitoring, specific to stormwater and hydrology graphs to look at how upstream improvements for development, or for city projects or for private projects can reduce the flow or reduce the downstream impacts.
14:51:28 And what we're trying to see is lowering that peak of the Hydra graph.
14:51:34 We don't do this for every storm water project but we do it for ones that we know are going to be a large capital investment, or if there's a very very keen public interest in it with the Watershed Council, or with one of our other groups and groups,
14:51:49 it kind of goes insane without saying we're looking for the science and data to show the improvements and almost validate what we're working on for our capital improvement projects.
14:52:02 One of the metrics that we look at in the city event or were specific to storm water is imperviousness.
14:52:08 I mentioned those Creek shifts that we have in town.
14:52:11 We look at impervious area procreation because we recognize that there's kind of a land use pattern that works that falls within several of these creatures areas.
14:52:21 The number doesn't always go down the number might go down and we don't measure it.
14:52:27 The way we get this information for impervious areas is every three years, we have a flyover done of the city with color infrared photography, looking for impervious cover, and leave off conditions so the tree canopy cover, and we can calculate that by
14:52:47 personal, so we overlay this data so we can start looking at where are there are improvements are where are there opportunities for improvements, as I mentioned, Ellen Creek and melons Creek, or the highest by far.
14:52:59 They're also the most developed by far.
14:53:02 We can't take out downtown.
14:53:05 Can't take out brighter wood mall we can't take out some of these larger apartment developments. But what we can do is look for opportunities within those developments maybe their stormwater islands within a parking lot, maybe it's a green roof, green
14:53:20 roof certainly addresses the impervious cover because it does up take some of that storm water.
14:53:27 What's really great about this though is that it's a long term measurement that we can start making. I don't know that the needle is going to move super quick.
14:53:35 I'd love to say that maybe by the time I retire in 20 some odd years, maybe some of these numbers will have gone down by a percent.
14:53:42 It took us 100 and so many years hundred and 50 years for in order to grow into what we have now. And now we're managing and fostering those resources that have been left for us.
14:53:54 So with that I'm actually going to stop and pause.
14:53:58 That's a really high overview of our utility systems, I could probably talk for an hour about sanitary sewage which is really exciting, you know, an hour about poop.
14:54:08 I could talk an hour about drinking water I could talk now about stormwater. If you have further questions. We're certainly available, but I am going to turn it over to Sarah, so she can kind of hone in on some of the specific issues around drinking water.
14:54:38 know where to go back to switch
14:54:49 to your question drags boy.
14:54:54 Yeah, I got real.
14:55:00 Okay, can you hear me. Is this working of it. Okay.
14:55:10 I certainly never expected to have this job I didn't have any idea actually that this job existed.
14:55:19 All the time I was doing my studies, so I basically studied carbon cycling in the Arctic.
14:55:28 For most of my PhD work, and then ended up somehow doing a postdoc here at the University of Michigan, actually in this building with rose Corey, looking at harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie so I was out on Lake Erie.
14:55:45 In 2014, when the algal bloom was so bad that it shut down the Toledo water intake, and I was, I mean it was literally out on the boat taking samples, thinking, there's this whole community that doesn't have water because of this.
14:56:02 This phenomenon that I'm studying. What if I could do something actually to help with the water versus just sort of trying to understand I guess I was more interested in application so.
14:56:18 So I made the switch and became a consultant, and spent three years working with a wide array of a wide array of utilities around the country.
14:56:30 And really found the area of emerging contaminants to be fascinating, so I ended up sort of specializing in emerging contaminants and optimizing water treatment processes for emerging contaminants.
14:56:48 It ended up that I wanted to actually be able to make my own decisions as a consultant what you, you can do the best work that you can, and then it's totally up to your client, if they actually do anything about it.
14:57:03 And so I ended up coming to Ann Arbor to be the water quality manager and I have to say it's been really great.
14:57:09 I have a water treatment plant that does chemistry, on a scale that I still sometimes can't believe we can treat up to 50 million gallons of water per day.
14:57:22 And we have a very complex process. I think the fortuitous thing is that we ended up p FOS sort of exploded about three or four months after I came on board.
14:57:36 So, it turns out that all of my experience with emerging contaminants actually ended up being used, although we obviously had no idea that that was going to happen when I was hired.
14:57:47 So with that I want to talk a little bit. I mean, I want to talk about drinking water treatment in Ann Arbor, and then I'm going to talk about some of the emerging issues that we face.
14:57:59 So, we have two sources of water for our water treatment plant. We have.
14:58:08 Yes, let's see, can I use the mouse to point.
14:58:15 Okay, so we have an intake at the Huron River right at Barton pond, we get about 80% of our water from there. And then we have some groundwater wells.
14:58:26 Here at the Municipal Airport, so the water from both of these sources is pumped up here to the water treatment plant.
14:58:35 We soften the water and I'll show a process diagram on the next slide, but one of the things that we're that I'm actually very proud of is that we are constantly monitoring our source water, the treatment process and then the water out in the distribution
14:58:54 system to make sure that the water that we, the water that we're producing and that we're providing to our customers is safe so we take almost 180,000 discrete chemical measurements every single year.
14:59:09 So every hour of every day we're taking measurements. We also have a lot of online instruments so that doesn't actually even include sort of any of the online, like turbid meters and flow meters, things like that.
14:59:23 So actually, that's one of the opportunities, I guess I see in the field of water is that we have a lot of data. And we don't necessarily have the tools to use this data.
14:59:36 The way that I think we could. I think that there are many issues that we face and we have the information, but we need more data science tools, actually, to, to be able to process the data.
14:59:50 I routinely max out, Excel, just trying to pull in data and analyze it so that's just my plug for data science.
15:00:01 I'm looking at our treatment process. We have to stage softening so the river, the river water goes through both stages of softening, and the well water primarily goes through, only the second stage of softening.
15:00:20 And
15:00:20 the reason that it's really important that the river goes through both stages of softening is that that's one of the ways that we really clean the water we remove all of the particles we're removing bacteria, viruses through that softening stage.
15:00:36 And we're also obviously softening the water so the water in the harbor area is very hard in the river we average a hardness of about 300 milligrams per liter.
15:00:47 And in the wells were averaging five to 600.
15:00:52 milligrams per liter of hardness and just for reference, you would feel like a water was fairly soft, or like comfortably soft when it's probably in like the 50 to 90 range.
15:01:06 So our water is very hard and that's actually the primary reason that the, the Ann Arbor established a water treatment plant because they were taking well water and injecting it straight into the system and it was basically plugging everything up because
15:01:18 of the really high levels of hardness. So, we have this softening plants that removes the hardness that also removes a lot of the particulates it removes organic material.
15:01:32 And from that second stage of softening, then we go straight into our ozone disinfection and we use ozone as our primary disinfectant.
15:01:43 The great thing about ozone is that, it pretty much reacts with everything.
15:01:54 The other thing about ozone is that pretty much reacts with everything and so you get a residual for about 10 minutes. So it's not a long lasting disinfection but it is a disinfection that gives us the basically kills the bacteria and virus and Cryptosporidium
15:02:05 that we need. So, we have ozone.
15:02:16 Then we have biologically active regular activated carbon filters and the reason that these filters are biologically active is partially because bacteria really love carbon that's like a really great media for them to grow on so actually any carbon filter
15:02:34 that you have has bacteria growing at it I can guarantee it.
15:02:46 But the reason that it's particularly important to us is that ozone breaks carbon up into little small pieces that bacteria really love.
15:02:48 And so, if you don't remove those before you send the water out into the distribution system you end up having a lot of bacteria growing in your water pipes, which are for obvious reasons is not desirable.
15:03:03 So we have these biologically active carbon filters which I'll talk a little bit more about later but I like to think of these filters as the heart and soul of our process so they're working for us and that they're physically streaming the water.
15:03:18 They're also chemically absorbing compounds like the carbon is a really good media for absorbing things. And then they have the bacteria that are also removing removing compounds and eating things so that is our filters and then as I mentioned previously,
15:03:37 the ozone disinfection only last up until the filters, and then we have this water that has been filtered but we need to disinfect it before we send it out into the pipes because it needs to still be safe to drink up to 10 days later when it gets to customers
15:03:55 sort of at the far reaches of the city so we use a combined chlorine and chloramines.
15:04:04 And that's the disinfectant that we use it has a lot of benefits if you do it right, it's tasteless. So, Detroit. On the other hand, uses pre chlorine and so a lot of, you can really tell the difference.
15:04:18 Honestly between the two if you do a side by side smell test. The Detroit water is going to smell a little bit more like a swimming pool and in our birds water should really smell like nothing.
15:04:30 We recently did a project actually to add UV disinfection to our treatment plant.
15:04:36 There were some updated rules, and we needed to add additional disinfection based on levels of Cryptosporidium in the river. So, that UV treatment just came online in July.
15:04:52 So Jen hit some of these highlights. But the water service area that we have is about 50 square miles and we serve a population of approximately 125,000.
15:05:06 I mentioned that our treatment plant can treat up to 50 MTD, but on average we're only using 14.
15:05:26 MTV of that capacity and that's partly because we need to be able to treat water to the highest possible demand in the hottest possible year with the least amount of rain and also there's fires.
15:05:30 So you need to be able to to.
15:05:33 That's what you design your system to is sort of the extreme case of need and then you often end up using, much less of that capacity than.
15:05:41 Then you have. We have a bunch of storage tanks around the city, you probably seen our two water towers there's one out by County Farm Park, and then one on North Campus, we do sell to silo township and in Arbor Township.
15:05:58 And we have a bunch of different pressure districts and Arbor is not flat.
15:06:04 And that when you are distributing water. The best thing is for the water to flow downhill by gravity so that's part of the reason that the water treatment plant is located up on water Hill it's the second tallest spot in the city so we're able to feed
15:06:18 that whole central central downtown district, just with gravity the water just flows out of the treatment plant, but for all of these other locations we actually have to pump the water to increase the water pressure to serve to serve those areas.
15:06:37 So that's sort of the overview of the water of water treatment and now I want to get into two emerging contaminants. The first one is one for dioxane, and this is a, this, I would just like to point out we have actually a lot of information available
15:06:55 and even in the past month. There have been some developments in terms of the litigation.
15:07:02 So, if you just go to the water treatment website we have all of the links available. I'm actually not going to cover the litigation that's,
15:07:14 that's really just not my area of expertise what I'm here to talk about is how potentially one for dioxin would impact the drinking water, not how it impacts, just sort of the the water in general.
15:07:27 So that is my caveat.
15:07:30 So, the groundwater in in our birth is contaminated with one for dioxane.
15:07:37 So, this is just a map of the plume you can see sort of here's the area where we know that there.
15:07:45 There's one for dioxane in the groundwater. And, for example, here's West Park, I believe. So just to give you some orientation of where this is.
15:07:58 So, as you might remember so we get our water up here from Barton pond and then way far south from the airport so this plume doesn't actually impact, either of our water sources, yet.
15:08:14 Um, so one of the things that people are looking at is, there's this little,
15:08:21 little bump here. And it seems like potentially this little bump is growing and that the plume is actually migrating North so if we zoom out.
15:08:32 What we're looking at is this right here.
15:08:34 So there's some fear that this little knob means that the plume is migrating north, and we'll hit the river up here, sort of upstream of where we take our water, so.
15:08:50 So that is the fear with drinking water The thing about groundwater is that it moves really slowly so the best estimate is that it would be at least 50 years before the plume would hit the river.
15:09:02 And we just don't have enough data to know if this is actually happening.
15:09:07 But the great thing is that the water treatment plant is actually really well positioned to be able to handle it. So, even just with our current treatment process we've done tests, and we can remove up to about 70 to 80% of anyone for dioxane that's in
15:09:26 the water just because of our existing ozone disinfection.
15:09:31 But if we wanted to increase our treatment we could do UV hydrogen peroxide or hydrogen peroxide and ozone and that would give us levels of removal in the 99% range so we have.
15:09:48 for us to alter our treatment process to deal with it. But again, this isn't a decision, we're going to have to make.
15:10:00 Even in the course of, you know, one year or five years, it's a very long term decision and will have a lot of advanced warning.
15:10:11 So, our treatment plant was built in 1938 and we are still actually using a lot of that infrastructure.
15:10:18 It's sort of past its useful life and we're looking to about 100 million dollar project to upgrade part of our treatment plans, and in that upgrade.
15:10:30 We would expect that that needs to be used for the next 50 to 75 to 100 years and so as we go into that project we will definitely be looking at what what would happen if we had to treat for one for docs thing.
15:10:46 So now we'll move into p FOS, I don't know if you've heard about p bass but they have been in the news a lot.
15:10:55 PPFAS stands for per employee floral alcohol substances. And this is a family of over 4000 compounds.
15:11:07 So it's a, we don't actually know even what all of these are because a lot of them are trade secrets we just know that they're compounds that have Floridians carbon 14 buttons.
15:11:29 And the reason that there's so many of these and they're used in a lot of products, is that they have really great chemical properties they're, they're sort of resistant to oil and resistant to water so they're used in nonstick cookware they're using
15:11:38 stain resistant water resistant textiles, a lot of food wrappers are coated in p fast so that the oil doesn't leak through.
15:11:47 And then they're also using a lot of industrial application so firefighting foam metal plating and other processes. So, even in some dental floss just, you know, it glides really well it's probably got p FOS on it honestly.
15:12:03 But the reason that we're concerned about these is that these are their stable and they don't degrade the carbon Florian bond is really one of the strongest bond that exists, which is part of the reason that these are great to us.
15:12:15 But, basically once they get out they, they don't go anywhere, they just keep on cycling through the environment, and their bio a cumulative. So, once they're invested.
15:12:28 They have a very long Half Life in your body.
15:12:32 And we're still. This is an active area of research we're still learning about health impacts but some of the ones that have been studied for the longest we know may have may interfere with hormone function.
15:12:44 They might cause your cholesterol to increase they will increase certain types of cancer risks, and they will likely impact your immune system. So, these are compounds that we are concerned about.
15:13:00 Luckily, in Ann Arbor.
15:13:04 Right now, the filtration with carbon is the best way to remove these p FOSS compounds from water, and we've been using jz filtration, since 1989 so even before we knew that this was an issue, we've been using the best available technology to remove them
15:13:21 just sort of by happenstance.
15:13:25 And just a note, different types of carbon absorb chemicals at different rates. So that's one thing that has been very important for us is that we're looking at what is the best type of carbon to us in our filters, so that we can remove p for the best.
15:13:42 So if we look at the history we actually didn't know that we had p FOS in the water until 2014.
15:13:49 And that was the first time we detected it.
15:13:53 Finally, in 2016, we identified the Huron River as a source and that's actually kind of unexpected. Most p Fox contamination is normally associated with groundwater.
15:14:07 So because we had wells on an airport where potentially they could have been using firefighting foam, we sort of thought that was a likely culprit but it turns out it was the Huron River.
15:14:19 So, as we were talking with our carbon vendor, we have been testing new different types of carbon we've been really aggressively changing out our filters.
15:14:31 And we've been doing active research. So we're really addressing p FOS very actively. And one of the things to note is that actually just this summer Michigan published limits for these compounds so we now have seven different drinking water limits for
15:14:51 seven different compounds, and I'll show you those in a second.
15:14:56 So what does RP FOSS, and people at data look like so people some people are the two compounds that have been studied the most in terms of P fast, and they also tend to have the.
15:15:12 Maybe some of the worst health impacts they're the most bio a cumulative and so you can see that their limits are in the eight to 16. parts per trillion rain and apart petroleum is one drop in an Olympic sized swimming pool, so we're talking very small
15:15:29 concentrations.
15:15:31 And what you can see the blue is the cure on River and the Orange is the drinking water.
15:15:37 And so you can see that certainly the concentration fluctuate in the river, which is one of the reasons that have having the river be the source of PS actually makes this more complicated because we don't.
15:15:52 On any given day we don't necessarily know what the concentration is, it can vary depending on what our sources are doing upstream.
15:16:01 But you can see that, sort of, in this time range. We were really actively addressing our, the type of carbon in our filters and increasing the amount that we change out, and we've basically gone to non detects in the drinking water for these two compounds
15:16:19 so the strategy that we're using is working really well for these two.
15:16:26 And I mentioned that the.
15:16:29 Well, yeah. And I mentioned that the that the state of Michigan has limits for seven of these compounds I'm just showing.
15:16:36 These are the seven compounds.
15:16:39 And these are the concentrations that we currently have in our drinking water so even the two that we do detect for orders of magnitude below what the limit is one thing that I'm sure you'll note is that some of these have limits of six and some of these
15:16:53 have limits of 400,000. So that really has everything to do with the likelihood that these compounds will bio accumulate so this this compound that's called PFHXA.
15:17:09 It really doesn't bio accumulates so when you ingest it, it sort of goes through you, a lot faster than this one here that PFNA which has a much longer halfway, so that's why you have sort of this this wide array of maximum contaminant limit, but, um,
15:17:30 with that bit of information. One of the things that the state of Michigan has asked us to do is to measure.
15:17:38 Basically 24 to 28, of these p FOSS compounds that we have known standards for so we were measuring basically everything that we can.
15:17:47 And then we add those numbers, all together.
15:17:51 So, I guess based on what I just told you that I could have 400,000, parts per trillion of one compound, and it would be basically the same amount of risk as six parts per trillion of a different compounds, adding all these numbers together doesn't actually
15:18:08 tell you that much because you don't know if you have 20 parts per trillion of this compound, you would be really worried but if you have 20 parts per trillion of this compound.
15:18:21 You know you're, you're not really in a risk level.
15:18:24 So, but this is one of the things that we have been looking at as well so this total p FOS number.
15:18:48 in the past, companies were using these compounds like PFOSMPFOA which are longer chain carbons and they're actually easier to remove from water.
15:18:59 Now, pls a PFA are basically outlawed, or they're illegal to use in some contexts.
15:19:07 So now they've been switching to shorter carbon chain links, and these are actually much harder to remove and so
15:19:15 we're currently doing actually after research to figure out how we can remove those shorter chain compounds. Luckily, they're not as bio cumulative so the health impacts are not going to be as great.
15:19:27 Um, but obviously we want to do the best weekend to protect public health and so we're working on optimizing our treatment so this is actually a master student but I've had working with me for the past year and a half and she's been looking at different
15:19:41 types of carbon. We're also experimenting with ion exchange.
15:19:47 To see if maybe we need another technology to better remove p FOSS, but really I think one of the most important things that we continue to work on is.
15:19:58 We know most of the sources for these compounds in our watershed and in fact there's one primary source which is a metal player that that discharges through an industrial pretreatment permit to wastewater treatment plant wastewater treatment processes
15:20:14 are not meant to remove p Fox, and so that just come straight down the river.
15:20:20 So, we have been working very hard to advocate.
15:20:26 It is much easier to treat a concentrated stream of waste in a smaller volume than it is to treat sort of dilute contaminants at a 50 million gallon per day scale.
15:20:40 So, I just want to take a step back actually from drinking water and say, in the city of Ann Arbor we're very committed to holistically dealing with issues.
15:20:50 So, we haven't just said, Oh look, we have the drinking water and we're figuring that out. We've also been looking at the here on River, which has, which is where the cost is coming from.
15:21:03 We've been looking at wastewater because one of the primary sources of our wastewater is the drinking water so we know that that P FOSS is, you know, moving through the state of Michigan has been doing a lot of work on p FOS and fish and foam and we've
15:21:19 been cooperating with them on that and then firefighting phone which is one of the big sources of P bass contamination sort of in the world.
15:21:29 And one of our, I guess, proudest stories is that we really proactively reached out to our fire department and talked with them and help them to identify a type of form that doesn't actually have fluorine in it.
15:21:46 And so before really anything happened at the state level, our fire department had already switched to this flooring free foam. And they manifest, they sent all of their flooring containing foam off as hazardous waste.
15:22:01 We also worked with in our watersheds to talk with other fire departments to talk with them about why fluorine and firefighting phones is problematic, and that they could switch, and we've done our job pretty well, educating wise.
15:22:20 And so now, there have been several instances where there's been a car fire where they need to use theoretically they need to use this type of phone, and they've contacted other fire departments are contacting our fire department to ask us to use our
15:22:35 phone on the fire because there's a chance that the water will end up in here on River. So, we've really been, we're not just sort of saying we've fixed to the drinking water we're okay we're really focused on holistically, dealing with this, and the
15:22:51 way that we're doing that is through a lot of advocacy and outreach so we're reaching out to our customers we're educating our employees.
15:23:03 We're also working within our water said, we've done a lot of work with the state we were actually heavily involved in developing the MCs for the state of Michigan.
15:23:15 This is the water treatment plant manager and he testified in front of a committee about p FOS, and we've also been doing a lot of outreach with the media so sort of taking a step back from science a little bit, it's important to have really good science
15:23:31 and data but also if you can't communicate your, your message you, you may as well not have all of your science and data because in the end we need our customers to support us and we we want people to feel good about drinking the water that we've spent
15:23:49 all of this work, making. So, this is the team that I work with every day.
15:23:56 We staff the water treatment plant 20 473 65.
15:24:01 And we're responsible for all of the operations and maintenance of this 50 million gallon per day facility so it's a lot of work but
15:24:12 every person who, who does it does it because they like contributing to the community. So with that, I'll put up my contact information if you ever do have water quality questions.
15:24:26 I will be the one that you'll end up talking with anyway so please feel free to reach out and then I don't know if we are taking questions or what's next, but I'm done with my part.
15:24:50 live folks at ritual folks
15:25:31 a lot of like bottled water, they'll drink from that and I actually know about this whole process and you know we live on campus. Just like curious if you know anything that doesn't do anything.
15:25:37 That's what I'm curious.
15:25:40 Well, yes. Okay, so the British filter removes all of the chlorine residual, and it grows bacteria. So you have a biologically active filter on your counter that you're using.
15:25:55 And any water that's coming out of it doesn't have a disinfectant residual so
15:26:03 I actually had I've run into some houses where they decided that they wanted a whole house filter. And then were really upset that there was a lot of like bacteria growing everywhere because turns out when you, when the water is not disinfected it bacteria
15:26:19 will grow, that's just the way it goes. So, I'm honestly, removing of chemicals and the filter is likely not any better than the 26 Industrial size filter that we use on a daily basis of the water treatment plant.
15:26:40 However, I will say that though, the one time that I do recommend people use household filters as if they're concerned about lead in their plumbing. So, this would be a banner has removed, really, all of the lead.
15:26:55 Like in front of the houses but even up until 2017 household fixtures could have a certain percentage of lead in them and we very tightly control our chemistry.
15:27:07 To minimize any sort of lead coming out and all of the data shows that we're doing a good job but for sure, in some of these old houses there's lead solder there's lead, lead Foster, I mean lead and faucets and so if that's if that's a concern but you
15:27:24 do have to buy them a filter that is certified to remove lead and a lot of these just normal breath.
15:27:32 For this act because you need the water takes a lot a long time to dream through the filters that remove lead. So,
15:27:45 I mean, bottled water is pretty expensive, and also is not actually regulated or tested as much as drinking water. I'm not saying that it's not safe. I'm just saying that like it has.
15:28:01 It hasn't environmental impact and monetary fiscal impact.
15:28:08 There's also some concern about the amount of micro plastics that when you open a bottle you're making micro plastics, we don't know the health impacts of micro plastics, but just that is.
15:28:22 Yeah.
15:28:27 Hi, um, first off, thank you guys so much for coming. Both your presentations are really interesting.
15:28:36 And one question, and the older pipes that we used to use, you had mentioned how they were older and thicker and they're made of a better quality so they tend to last longer, um, do we purposely build with less quality materials.
15:28:47 Now, in hopes of like more regular updating of our pipes or is there like a cost associated with using less quality pipes now, are we losing or making money off of that system.
15:29:05 So, what I understand your question is, are the pipes we're using less of less quality manufacturing processes have changed over 100 years. So it's not necessarily that we're looking at a lesser quality, because the pipes are still doing their job.
15:29:23 What we're running into is these pipes that were put in over 100 years ago maybe we're just have a thicker wall, and they just last longer. They're still providing the service that they're required for they're still distributing they're still conveying.
15:29:39 It's just the management type is a little bit different now because they're all of these different thicknesses of pipes in the ground. I would not say there are lesser quality I just say I would just say they have a shorter life span.
15:29:51 And when we think about designing an infrastructure that has to last for 50 7100 years, we look at maximizing that lifespan for a cost benefit analysis.
15:30:03 Thank you.
15:30:06 Can I ask one more question, sorry.
15:30:10 Um, so you had mentioned imperviousness and how it was, um, I mean, my understanding is just that it means to not allow water to flow, can you explain what you meant by that in the context of the city's watershed.
15:30:23 Does that mean we have a lot of stagnant water for that, like, part isn't necessarily allowing or not allowing water to flow imperviousness is allowing water to infiltrate back into the ground.
15:30:38 So if you think about a lawn versus a parking lot of parking lots going to be 100% impervious it's rock hard water is not going to soak into it back into the groundwater recharging our groundwater resources, whereas a lawn.
15:30:57 If it rains a lot but probably be a little bit of runoff but a majority of the water on a lawn is going to soak in, so it is previous for rainfall.
15:31:09 Does that help the. Yeah, Thank you.
15:31:17 I got a question for you. Jen, which was, you know, one of the things we hear about climate change is like heavier rain halls like more concentrated and I'm wondering, like how that how that change in precipitation patterns impacting planning around some
15:31:35 of the storm water systems that the city is using budget. Can I hear you speaking over there, so
15:31:55 good.
15:31:48 It's actually really good question and I mentioned in the beginning of my discussion that Ann Arbor as a leader in the Great Lakes region when it comes to stormwater management.
15:31:56 Because of our relationship with the University of Michigan and Lisa and the Great Lakes research facilities we've been kind of ahead of the game, looking at how to adapt our practices for climate mitigation.
15:32:12 So we recognize that there are larger rain events that are coming more frequently of a larger intensity, but potentially a shorter duration to you guys.
15:32:23 Maybe if you start looking at. I actually have an entire presentation on climate adaptation and stormwater management.
15:32:31 Um, it's really interesting because we with the research facilities that we have, we've been able to look at how rainfall has changed in the last hundred years, specific to the Ann Arbor region, which is really good because it's essentially a micro point
15:32:48 of data, as opposed to all of Michigan or all of the Great Lakes region because, as I mentioned rainfall falls differently in different places.
15:32:57 What we have been seeing is more rain quicker, but maybe not as often. So we're having to design our systems to hold more water, but not for a really long time because it's going to infiltrate back into the soil or enter into our storm water system at
15:33:18 a slower rate. We don't want to overwhelm our systems. So it's not always building a bigger pipe, it's building, storage, and we've incorporated those design parameters and criteria into our stormwater standards.
15:33:35 So when a developer comes in and designs a new stormwater management system, or when we build a new road and put in a new storm water pipe. We are Designing to mitigate or adapt our practices to mitigate and address the more intense storms.
15:33:53 For that shorter duration. So it's kind of built into the engineering behind the scenes. It's not an in your face, we're not doing anything drastically visibly different.
15:34:04 It's just that we've changed the philosophy of how we manage stormwater, and we don't build a bigger pipe and push it to our neighbors downstream because that's not only the not that's not the right thing to do.
15:34:14 It's not a nice thing to do, but we recognize that treating storm water where it falls, is the most beneficial for the environment and most beneficial for the community as well as the water quality in there in the community.
15:34:26 Good question.
15:34:29 I can share my presentation if you like.
15:34:38 lot of sort of environments.
15:34:41 lockdown and whatnot. I'm wondering if you all have any data, like, I'm just curious, personally, how did this summer go I know it was really hot and dry and you see like a notable uptick in use.
15:35:02 I know there's a lot of variables there but I was just wondering if people are targeting phenomenon.
15:35:06 Like watering.
15:35:10 I'm going to answer that question a few different ways because I have my Ann Arbor hat on. I don't live in town I actually live near Detroit, the use over there was very different.
15:35:30 Ann Arbor, the community. If you think about who lives here. There's a large population on campus.
15:35:29 So, our water use as a hole in the city of an arbor dropped because there were no students, there was no University, there was no research, there was no faculty labs working.
15:35:41 So, overall, the water use went down.
15:35:46 But if you flip it and just focus on residential, we saw, at least from Erin irrigation standpoint we saw an uptick, and people aren't taking more showers I mean hopefully they're still taking a shower at home, I don't know, maybe they took lesser, I
15:36:04 don't know. But did you guys see anything at the plant, specifically for the.
15:36:09 Yeah, so I guess we just overall, we've seen a decrease in demand, and that's still continuing today and part of that is offices are still not open.
15:36:19 So there's a lot of businesses downtown and office parks around the area and they're not using water schools are closed, so their husband actually some interesting water quality related things that we've seen so normally.
15:36:39 There are. So, for example, up by skyline. High School there's skyline normally pulls a lot of water and there's some neighborhoods up there where their water is getting older, basically, and they're having, maybe.
15:36:56 Like, if the water gets really old it starts having a little bit of a smell and we've just seen more of that this year then maybe we have in previous years, next to these schools where the neighborhood is normally a flow through to the school and without
15:37:09 the school pulling water, there's problems we were also fairly concerned about building water quality.
15:37:20 Luckily, not like well in in our reviews, a disinfectant. That's actually really good for water being stagnant it last longer, and also come back to a specific type of pathogen that likes to grow and stuff stagnant water is called Legionella.
15:37:37 And so that's one of the things that other cities were fairly concerned about is all these buildings that were shut out for three months. No, are used and then people come back into them and the plumbing.
15:37:47 There's maybe back in the plumbing so actually very proactively reached out to businesses so what we ended up doing was.
15:37:57 I ran water like water consumption numbers from last spring. And this spring, and then I calculated. I pulled out all of the businesses that were using 25 or like 50 or less percent of the water from the same time last year so places that had had greater
15:38:20 than a 50% decrease in the water consumption that, that they had.
15:38:25 And there were about, probably 1200 businesses where they actually use, you know, they use zero water. And so we sent them basically a letter saying, hey, before you open up your building.
15:38:40 Here's some ideas for what you want to do to make sure that water is is safe. I'm particularly for schools and childcare facilities, it's really important.
15:38:50 So, I guess maybe that's not so much a youth.
15:38:55 But there, there were definitely things with Kogan that that have made us manage water differently.
15:39:09 We're doing right now but do you have any like changes and how your.
15:39:19 You all function contingency with our other operating. So actually, there's normally a valve that we have to open to make sure that we get enough water to the stadium.
15:39:26 And we're definitely not opening that one this year because there's without the crowd there's not going to be enough water use.
15:39:38 The questions.
15:39:40 I have a question as much as I am really glad you both touched on the public engagement issue.
15:39:46 Just because I think, Sarah is kind of alluded to this is like there's often think about the logistics and some of the science in terms of managing the systems and and that's certainly super important, but you know the example of the fact that you all
15:40:04 you all have to communicate with, with the public with elected officials with people who may not necessarily know anything about how the system operates.
15:40:18 And so just to be able to do that in a way that people can understand and make sense of and be able to better appreciate what goes into the whole process.
15:40:27 I just think that that was a great thing to emphasize, and probably not one that a lot of people working in the positions that you have, get a lot of experience with before you start that right after the fact.
15:40:44 Totally. So I worked for local government for over 25 years and one way or another, and Ann Arbor is the definitely the most engaged community I have ever worked with.
15:40:58 I worked with the community in Oakland County. I worked as a consultant for many Oakland County communities doing the same kind of work. And if we had a public meeting about a project, maybe one person would show up.
15:41:11 Maybe, and usually it was somebody who lived right on the project and they wanted to make sure that the playground wasn't destroyed, even though we weren't touching the playground we were working on the road in front of our house in in our, we just had
15:41:24 actually last Thursday. We're building a regional detention pond over near silo church and I 94. We had 25 people show up for a, an outdoor field walk, just to let just to see where the pond was going to go.
15:41:41 That's incredible. And when I tell my cohorts and other communities. They're astounded by that.
15:41:46 But what I think it's not just this community reacting it's that I also think we push a lot of information out. We are very informative we're very proactive and in transparency almost, what is it that we're doing, why are we doing it.
15:42:02 What's the science and data behind it. This is why we're doing it. And if you have more questions, we want to talk to you about it.
15:42:10 So it's more of a, an alliance or an allegiance rather than. This is government doing what we say we want to do
15:42:18 a good time to work in government.
15:42:22 That's good to hear.
15:42:40 Coming in a little bit asking about what was the day to day was like on the year. Well, so, um, I came here.
15:42:44 I'll get to the Tilly do but I came here, I'm actually thinking I was going to continue my work in the Arctic but then we got this grant to work on Lake Erie.
15:42:54 So I didn't realize it until the first week but it turns out I get viciously seasick.
15:43:00 So I spent, you know, eight or nine hours a day on a boat. I'm taking. So, um, I was working with Noah and global and we were out on this little old Coast Guard boat we get up super early drive down to Toledo.
15:43:19 I wouldn't drive because I would already be taking my motion sickness medication that made me kind of groggy but anyways this is maybe this is personal to me, obviously, other people did feel work and had a great experience.
15:43:35 But we had, I think, nine or 10 monitoring points around the basin.
15:43:44 And we would go to each of those points, and there were probably five different groups that were working on this and so each of them would have like a different parameter that they would be measuring they would lower songs.
15:43:58 I was taking water from different depths, using like a pair of Celtic pump and a tube. And then I would take all of that water down below deck, and I would be mad I was measuring hydrogen peroxide so I did a lot of very, like, high petting 100 micro leader
15:44:17 Eloqua into small test tubes and for texting them, which is really hard to do when you're seasick I'm just going to say it.
15:44:25 So.
15:44:28 So the interesting thing about the bloom on Lake Erie is that it goes through this really interesting life cycle and they would sort of describe it based on what kind of soup.
15:44:41 It looked like that day So does it look like egg drop soup or does it look like split pea soup or are we to like jello or, you know, and it definitely got to line jello that year.
15:44:54 So, I do remember, I was, we, we had one of our designated weekly field days that when the Toledo water intake was shut down and I remember driving down that morning, and all of the cars, sort of going we're like trucks pickup trucks that had a bunch
15:45:24 bottled water in in the back of their truck because
15:45:30 that was just there was a sort of a watershed moment for me but also, it talks, it goes back to this whole thing about public engagement.
15:45:44 And basically, two years later they went back, two or three years later they went back and most citizens and deleted still didn't feel comfortable drinking their water.
15:45:51 Because of this, like one moment where they weren't quite prepared enough, and they had to issue this don't drink the water advisory and so I think for me, that's a really that has been something that I have taken to heart because you don't get
15:46:11 you basically get one shot. And if you if you mess it up it takes years and years and years to rebuild public trust and so that sort of deviated from the question about Lake Erie but but basically we would be out on the boat, taking samples and then bring
15:46:30 them back to the lab and spend the rest of the week processing them.
15:46:35 And it really was an awesome experience and great to work with so many different.
15:46:41 I mean it was a very interdisciplinary project.
15:46:59 The
15:46:59 ad networks.
15:47:02 You know if there's ever a time when you guys have.
15:47:08 So there's two distinct systems that are storm water drinking water.
15:47:14 The storm water system collects the runoff from the university properties. And sometimes it discharges to city stormwater. Sometimes it discharges directly to a county dream, and sometimes it discharges directly to waters of the state.
15:47:33 So, here on River.
15:47:35 Each of those different discharge points have a different set of rules.
15:47:42 I'm saying that because it, it's not one big.
15:47:48 The University have what's called an MS for permit from the state actually comes from the federal stormwater regulations, but it's a permit that allows that entity to discharge stormwater ms for stands for municipal separate storm sewer system, I had
15:48:07 to do that wants to make sure I have all the assets.
15:48:10 But we caught our ms for permit the city and the university both partner, because it's the same community that we all have to work within. They just have regulation or jurisdiction over their discharge points we have regulation over our discharge points.
15:48:26 So that's kind of, that's one example that I want to give you that there's this really great partnership, and it's it's stormwater it's rain water.
15:48:34 There's flooding on campus there's flooding in this city city streets run through campus so there's a little bit of a mix. But at the end of the day, the ultimate discharge point for all of us as the here on river, and we recognize that.
15:48:47 So that's the stormwater one, the drinking water one's a little bit different because we make the water at the city.
15:48:56 We distribute the water to our customers. But on the university campus, there are distribution lines that are connected to ours but then a distributed distribute that.
15:49:13 Additionally, so there are hydrants that are used are owned by the University on their own. There's distribution lines that are on their own, or actually working right now with the University on a kind of a maintenance agreement, because they actually
15:49:26 We're actually working right now with the University on a kind of a maintenance agreement, because they actually have their own crews for both of these systems to go out and work on them I told you guys we only have four guys on our storm water.
15:49:37 I think they have three guys working on their storm water.
15:49:37 It's the same kind of work. It's not duplicative because we have our own pipes, we have to manage they have their own pipes, we have to manage.
15:49:44 But there definitely is a partnership with the drinking water it's a little bit of a different regulatory agency though because we both have to answer to the state.
15:49:55 At the end of the day, they're permitted through the state or federal permitted through the state for water distribution. Our permits are a little bit different because we also make the water, not just distribute it, but their system at the university
15:50:08 level, still deals with different buildings different research labs.
15:50:14 Parking if I'm wrong Don't they have their own treatment for. In addition, for some of the labs for hot water loop so they don't, they're not permitted as a, like a secondary truth.
15:50:29 Correct.
15:50:28 Does that answer your question, though, it's messy, but it works really well because we have a lot of collaboration between the city and the university
15:50:40 time. We'll have more questions I can probably stick around
15:50:45 for five minutes. Otherwise, please give us a hand.
15:51:06 Climate education thing is we've actually been working a lot with research stuff here at the university.
15:51:12 I would love to do more.
15:51:20 And if there's more on the research and anything else, we're already doing the things we're already doing what we know we need to do to address major needs, which is nice and balanced beyond so many other municipalities, just being the science person
15:51:35 that I am I want to be more like let's keep working on what if I have somebody from the Washington County Health Department of my other class. And I get a very similar message from her which is like you know you're doing like 10 times more than most communities,
15:51:50 communities, but I still don't have so many more things that I really like to be doing.
15:51:59 And I think this is like a good example. Yeah.
15:52:06 No,
15:52:06 definitely, Sarah, obviously our recent in her career but when you start doing work in public service.
15:52:14 It takes a special kind of person to want to work for public service because you're doing everything you can but then the science part of us that know what we could do research we could do this.
15:52:25 And then you're like oh wait, that's not what we're supposed to do because we have our main goal of making sure people get clean water, that that's what the rates pay for, that's where the bills are paid on hand to find out so those partnerships come
15:52:38 in, they come in.
15:52:40 If there were any, you know, researchers on.
15:52:46 If the university wasn't here I think a lot of our research opportunities happen we wouldn't have a lot of the push the innovation, because we.
15:53:00 When I
15:52:59 think there's very, there's a lot of jealousy of what you guys have universe in your backyard, you have a we have a we have last two, but we kind of push each other university pushes us, we push the university.
15:53:16 Yeah.
15:53:17 Well, again, I appreciate you.
