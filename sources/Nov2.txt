14:29:57 But one of the characters
14:29:57 Mostly just felt bad for the Tigers honestly,
14:29:55 Mike.
14:29:57 Hey, Mike. Oh, nice.
14:29:59 Hello. How's it going, good, good, good now.
14:30:04 You're here.
14:30:05 Sorry I was making you nervous. Oh, no, no.
14:30:12 I wasn't worried.
14:30:11 Although these days you know with the technology, there's always like a little bit of uncertainty.
14:30:22 Mike, do you want to just try to share screen make sure I have that enabled properly. Sure. Thank you.
14:30:35 Awesome.
14:30:35 You're the figure like that too Can you see the whole thing. Yep. Perfect. All right.
14:30:47 Stop and now we are just waiting on a few more folks will give them a couple more minutes before we get going. Okay.
14:31:03 Did you, did you guys start out in person and then go to zoom or how did it.
14:31:07 We did well we started out hybrid so we had about, I don't know maybe eight to 10 that fairly regularly showed up and then rest were virtual and then we now we're all just virtual.
14:31:25 Now I'm just in some forest somewhere.
14:31:31 Yeah.
14:31:33 And he's getting he's getting ready to jump the border, depending on what happens.
14:31:45 I don't know if it would be that border had y'all to probably go to the, to the one a little further south just because it's nice and warm down there,
14:31:58 have you all been hand, maybe you'll cover this but questions and things of you people been popping up or doing it in chat or however it works. I'm good with whatever your norms are.
14:32:10 Yeah, it's a mixture of both it's also like, I don't know what your setup is like if you can see the chat or not.
14:32:18 You know, if you if you can see the chat that it's nice to be able to do them but sometimes if there's like a question we'll, we'll pause, or whatever and we can feel the chat for you.
14:32:41 we can definitely do that. And usually they're pretty good about checking in with them throughout which, you know, feel free to do that as well.
14:32:52 So I don't want to wait too much longer so maybe we'll get going here so before we get into our main topic for today everybody.
14:33:02 By the way, Hi everybody.
14:33:03 So wanted to remind you of the fact that we do have an assignment coming up next week right so we push the due date of the hidden water footprint assignment back to the November 9.
14:33:15 So remember, that's a week from today. So, if you do have questions, let us know about that.
14:33:23 Actually I think john we owe somebody a email response about a question about what they wanted to investigate so we'll, we'll respond to you soon about that.
14:33:33 Anything else I think that's the big thing.
14:33:38 So today we're going to continue our discussion that we started last week about the intersection between energy and water. And to do that we have a guest speaker with us today.
14:33:49 That's Mike Schreiber.
14:33:52 So please welcome Mike.
14:33:53 Mike is the regional Executive Director of the National Wildlife Federation the Great Lakes regional center.
14:34:01 They have been very involved in the whole Ambridge line five issue which you'll hear what you read about for today you'll hear more about from Mike.
14:34:10 Just to give you a little bit more about Mike's background, he actually was also the Education Director for the graham Sustainability Institute.
14:34:20 And prior to any also lectures with paid and Earth, he's a busy guy. He's got lots of things going on.
14:34:27 And then prior to being with the University of Michigan and the gramm Institute. He was also policy director of the Ecology Center.
14:34:36 So he has a extensive history working with environmental and water issues in the Midwest and Michigan specifically. So with that I will turn it over to Mike and let him take control.
14:34:49 Great. Well, thanks.
14:34:52 Welcome folks Nice to be with you, virtually, and thanks for being here on what I feel like I'll just acknowledge up front is. It's an odd day, I mean, every day is not day during the pandemic God might be light way of putting it, but I think with the
14:35:08 election looming I think I don't know about you all but it's been a little hard to focus in, I'm going to try and do that for the next hour and 20 and tell this tell the story, which is really about the, the McAnuff straits oil pipeline or line five.
14:35:25 And I want to tell you a little bit about how this came to be as an issue that went from something that really wasn't on the public radar at all to what's been the number one water issue for the state of Michigan for the last five years.
14:35:39 And to be clear I put the Flint water crisis is not as well beyond the water issue but it's become the number one environmental issue at a major issue.
14:35:48 Two years ago when our governor was elected, and our attorney general was elected and I want to kind of walk you through sort of where it came from, what role, my organization had in that.
14:35:58 And what it tells us a little bit about some of the larger trends in advocacy and in water policy and protection. Overall, just a little bit of background to get us going here, and I'm trying to do it so I seem to when I shared screen on last the chat
14:36:15 box I'm trying to figure out how I can get that up again so feel free to put things in chat but if I don't see it, or just just blurted out we can keep this free free flowing
14:36:29 tell you just a little bit about my organization, and who we are and what some of the other things we work on and then I'll dive into this issue. So you've got on this screen in front of you, a picture of some of the team that I have there's about 2025
14:36:44 of us here in Ann Arbor, another five folks spread across the region. And what we do is really four different areas. One, we've got a team that works on Great Lakes Restoration, and by that I mean getting some of the federal funding to protect them restore
14:37:04 the links the links themselves. We work on that in the Ohio River and the upper Mississippi based and as well, too. We work in the water policy space and then in the line five work is kind of a subset of that but we work on the issues like invasive species
14:37:19 keeping Asian carp out of the Great Lakes, for example, we work on Harmful Algal Blooms so like Lake Erie, when it turns green each summer and when six years ago, the people Toledo had no access to clean drinking water we're working on those kinds of
14:37:33 issues.
14:37:34 And we also work in the space of education and engagement for example we've got three staff in Detroit, but largely work on connecting urban youth to outdoor activities and and STEM education through that.
14:37:48 And part of our team there is also working on connecting houses of worship. So literally, churches, mosques synagogues, etc. And actually getting some outdoor space and native plant habitat there and outdoor worship space there.
14:38:01 And then we work on climate policy as well and climate resiliency. So those are some of the key areas but we wound up working on this issue here, the macro streets oil pipeline through a variety through a variety of ways, and I'll walk you through a little
14:38:19 bit sort of how it came to be. My prognosis of where it's going, we're kind of right in the midst of a big fight over this so I'm going to it's a warning you now.
14:38:29 Maybe this will keep your interest sort of a cliffhanger ending, you know we don't we don't know where this issue is going and that and that I probably said that I don't know how many years I've done this maybe the fourth year or something it for your
14:38:51 And it starts here folks may be familiar with this this is the Kalamazoo river that had a massive oil spill in 2010.
14:39:05 And here's what happened. This river and you see the image of the river itself in the, in the top left there.
14:39:13 And then the pipe that Russian, so you have an oil pipeline from Enbridge energy that ruptured in a tributary of the Kalamazoo.
14:39:25 No problem that the.
14:39:28 I won't click leave meeting or anything gave me the option that that in the in the Kalamazoo river, and a tributary had a ruptured.
14:39:39 And it was done by Enbridge energy, and we learned a few things so you actually see the actual pipeline that came out of the ground there.
14:39:47 And what happened was this pipeline was sitting in a wetland. For those of you who are more in the ecology side of things you might understand this wetlands have typically acidic soils acidic soils if you think about that they're more likely to corrode
14:40:04 a metal pipe, which is what you have here.
14:40:07 And that gap there. Got it started as a small gash in there. And then, as it was leaking.
14:40:18 The Emory janitors use a company based in Canada, and they had people at the control rooms there and they saw Oh wait, there's a drop in oil pressure in our pipeline right so there's, think of folks sitting in, I think it's an Edmonton, and they're kind
14:40:31 of sitting there going, wait, there's a drop of oil pressure here know what we need to do.
14:40:35 There's an air bubble we need to increase the amount of oil that's flowing through this right so they actually three different times increase the volume of oil over an 18 hour period, and you wind up with about a million gallons of oil that spilling out.
14:40:50 out. In fact, nobody noticed this until until people started smelling it and seeing it so it's coming from underground is coming up in the wetlands, you've got the pictures of some of the oiled animals there.
14:41:04 And, you know, this was a it was tar sands oil, for those of you who know what that is, you probably talked about it but this is heavy oil that comes from Canada this particular from the tar sands region in Canada.
14:41:18 It's sunk to the bottom and caused all kinds of problems. Now, the, the piece here that I think is most relevant this spill is its own ecological disaster, no question about you can still go to the Kalamazoo river, and you can still find oil that's embedded
14:41:34 in these weapons if you kick around you'll actually get some petroleum that comes up comes up to the top still.
14:41:41 But at the time and this was while I was still at U of M at the graham Institute as Jason mentioned that we had a young staffer then wF who had just graduated from Western Michigan.
14:41:54 I think a year before, and she was really doing kind of administrative UD issue that she was for us, but she was from this area so this spill happened almost literally in her backyard.
14:42:07 And she was actually working on our climate program, and she said you know can I take a little bit of my spare time here. And my time at work and start looking into this issue, because I don't want this to happen in other places I see the devastation
14:42:21 that it's caused.
14:42:23 So she then went out and started looking around and this was one of the first things she uncovered. she said, Well, okay.
14:42:32 line five.
14:42:35 Well, what ruptured was line. Can you can you see my cursor fabulous.
14:42:40 Yeah. Okay, so the rupture in line six p was right here. Okay, they've renamed it but it's, it's, it was called line six be part of Enbridge is kind of rebranding as they figured the line that rupture they probably should stop calling it that so it's
14:42:53 now called line 78, but this was it here.
14:42:56 But she said okay, the oil comes came from kind of up here in the tar sands it mixes a little bit with oil from the back end and North Dakota comes down here and it takes two pathways, either self around Chicago, and then up six be here.
14:43:13 Or, it goes across here, and this is what she, I wouldn't say discovered because it was known but she realized that there is another pipeline that runs through the state of Michigan.
14:43:23 And she explored specifically, specifically, what happens to get this pipeline from the upper peninsula to the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.
14:43:33 And her report on this called something hazard came out in. It was eight years ago now.
14:43:41 And it basically asked a lot of questions and it said okay, if the oil is going from one side of the up, or if it's coming from the up to the Lower Peninsula from one side of Lake Michigan to the other it's right where Lake Michigan like you're on come
14:43:56 together for those are familiar with the Great Lakes, geography, it's right on the lake michigan side of it. How does it do that. And she learned that there is a pipeline that was put down there in 1953 and her report called a hidden in plain view.
14:44:13 It wasn't literally forgotten about but it was nowhere on the public consciousness. Right, people didn't know about it, regulators in the state had heard of it but weren't doing any active management of it.
14:44:24 And it was built by a company called Lake head that Enbridge had acquired over time.
14:44:30 And the question was what state is this in what risks, does it pose this report is actually, it's a great piece again by a very very young advocate that asks a lot of questions.
14:44:42 Those questions, most of the state folks overseeing it are not able to answer it but they did learn that over 540,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquid so this isn't just oil.
14:44:55 There's oil, and then they batch through what's called natural gas liquid so think of a liquefied form of natural gas. So sometimes its oil about 80 90% of the time, then they stop the oil they have kind of a blocker between and then they have natural
14:45:08 gas is going through, and it's a pipeline that's 645 miles long, going from superior Wisconsin to Sardinia Ontario which is right across the bridge from Port Huron Michigan and kind of at the bottom of the thumb area of Michigan.
14:45:26 And it lies along the bottom of the macro streets so the assumption was, well, this must be in a tunnel or it must be somehow not exposed to the largest freshwater sources in the world.
14:45:37 Turned out that wasn't true.
14:45:38 And so what what she did and this was long before I was part of the story.
14:45:43 But what she did was, got some divers. These are volunteers I might add two people who were National Wildlife Federation members and professional divers that went down to take a look at this pipeline.
14:45:56 And this image that you see in front of you, which was taken gosh was a 2013 or 14 years set six seven years ago, has appeared in countless stories on this, because people realized all of a sudden Hey wait, there's an oil pipeline that's just sitting
14:46:12 in the open waters. And what you see there it's a little hard to tell what you see there these are wooden slats right so it was actually we learned a little bit more about how it was built.
14:46:21 It was built largely in this is a good thing as one was twin pipelines is actually the guy forgot to mention this, but it splits into two. So there are two about a half mile apart, they built it as one big long basically seamless pipe, and they put wooden
14:46:35 slats on it and their goal was to kind of take it and then slowly lower it down. Well actually, when they were in the straits doing this in 1953, they didn't account for the buoyancy right and the pipeline just suck all right and and that's, that is what
14:46:51 you see and what you see here are broken wooden slats right 1953 technology and put it under there. And you also see that in parts of it, it's sitting along the bottom of the water, and parts of it.
14:47:04 It's suspended the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac Ah, I don't believe I have this slide in this presentation. It's not just flat like this it's actually an ancient riverbed so it goes like this and actually as a big dip in the middle of it that was
14:47:16 an ancient river, right there. And so in the parts where it's deeper, it's actually sitting, it's above the water and sometimes it's supported and sometimes attained free, it's under the water only at the places closest to shore right right where you
14:47:31 would anchor only in the first few hundred feet.
14:47:35 And so we start learning more and more about that and people are getting very concerned, right this is in the largest freshwater source in the world of course, and you've got an activist coalition that starts to form around this.
14:47:47 This is for those who don't know that's Bill McKibben.
14:47:51 I would call him, he was probably the most Clint famous climate activist pre gratitude Burke I'm glad it's passed on to the next generation. Wonderful activist himself the founder 350 dot org or writer.
14:48:04 Originally and still. And he came up and helped start a coalition called oil and water don't mix all right and got this going got got people concerned about from a climate standpoint and from a water quality standpoint, what's going on here.
14:48:21 Now, so the National Wildlife Federation by the way I somehow the chat box is disappeared from my function so if you have questions, shout them out, raise your hands or john Jason Just tell me if there's something in there because I don't know somehow
14:48:32 and I shared screen the chat box went away and I can't seem to get it back. So, so please let me know.
14:48:39 toolbar on the top of your screen can you should be able to get the chat box through there.
14:48:43 Like if you have like options for annotation there it is. Thank you.
14:48:47 Perfect. That's, I've got the dual screen going and flip to my other screen.
14:48:52 Got it. Thank you very much that's helpful.
14:48:54 Now I just need to not put it right over my notes. Perfect. Okay.
14:49:00 So, we then hired out the University of Michigan.
14:49:05 Water Center to look at and this was was NWF did to look at what would happen if there's an oil spill here.
14:49:14 Let's do some modeling and let's see. And what you see here in the details aren't as important as the overall point of this, but what you see is, if water was released in this model the spill similar to the Kalamazoo river spill oil would slosh around
14:49:31 in very different ways like the, the red is what would happen when the oil hits the surface and you see this is backing on islands here. For reference, like grand hotels right here, this is, this is for those of you have been up to Northern Michigan.
14:49:44 This is the Mackinac Bridge, the pipelines right about here, right there. In fact,
14:49:50 the yellow is mid depth and actually in this model, the mid depth would go this is like Michigan. This is like here on the mid depth would largely go into Lake Huron in the bottom, it would get spread all right so you're going down the coast of Lake Huron
14:50:05 here. This is Beaver Island over here, so you can kind of see where we're at and what Dr. Dave Schwab hydrologist from NOAA, who was at U of M said, it's the worst possible place for an oil spill.
14:50:18 Now we always have to clarify right and I probably don't need to with you but there's no good place for an oil spill. All right, like, you know, he gets every time he says that to the media whenever he gets some snarky response.
14:50:28 But the thing here is you don't know where oil is going to go if there's a spill there. Alright, so, a spill on the Kalamazoo river devastating. You knew exactly where it's going to go.
14:50:40 It's not going to go up, it's not going to go upstream, it's going to get stopped to the dam which is ultimately what happened if you shut, if you stop the water from flowing through the dam at least at that point.
14:50:49 But here it's completely different, the flow rates in the Straits of Mackinac can be 10, times the flow of Niagara Falls 10 times that. But let's make it even even more complicated sometimes it's going east to west, right, sometimes it's heading this
14:51:04 direction sometimes going west to east, and sometimes it's horribly in different ways and again top middle and bottom can be going different directions.
14:51:12 On the same day. And if you've been up to Northern Michigan starting around this time of year.
14:51:18 It's a pretty it's a pretty hostile environment, right, and you've got ice there four or five months a year, depending on the year. In fact, October, November, you just yesterday, there were eight foot waves at the Straits of Mackinac All right.
14:51:34 So think about that if you have an oil spill there, what's going to happen when you, when you've got waves that high.
14:51:42 So we did one more, one more analysis coast where we asked, what's the probability of different areas getting oil. if there's an oil spill.
14:52:03 And this this graph again it's been all over the the media because it just shows the tail so well this deep red here, hundred percent chance of oil of oil reaching, not just a little bit we're talking a visible sheen so we're talking oil on the water
14:52:09 on the shorelines This is so much oil that you actually have to do a clean up of a federally mandated cleanup, we're not talking a drop of oil here, and the probabilities get lower the farther out you go, but they go all the way down.
14:52:21 This is the tip of the thumb the Detroit water intake is just off of this, you know, and actually you get detectable levels all the way down to Chicago.
14:52:29 So this kind of blew the issue up in a different way. Right. People are getting very concerned about this.
14:52:35 And some of our partners start looking at okay What is it, what is it that would happen from an economic standpoint.
14:52:44 If there's noise right what what's the damage to natural resources right what's the damage to the tourism industry. What's the damage to property values.
14:53:00 What about municipal water system mostly municipal water systems up there get the water from the lakes, and you start this is from our colleagues group that formed largely because of the potential for this oil spill called flow for the love of water and
14:53:09 a wonderful group based up in Traverse City, that does water resource protection.
14:53:14 And so they helped in it. This was an economist ecological economist and Ms you this.
14:53:21 So, now we're getting to the government reaction. Alright so we took an issue that no one had heard about, turn it into kind of a major thing, and we're going back one administration here This is Governor Snyder.
14:53:33 So when you are.
14:53:35 When you're governor and this is actually when he that we're going back seven years now, he was just coming up for for reelection.
14:53:43 And your governor you got a big problem on your hands people are saying you got to do something about this oil pipeline. Not really sure what to do, what do you do age old tradition, you form an advisory board.
14:53:54 All right, so there's there's people on government and this advisory board. He wanted me to this advisory board represented the conservation community.
14:54:02 This is the Vice President for Enbridge. This is the Vice President, or the president of marathon oil pipelines, which is based in. In Ohio, not far from here a couple of academics.
14:54:14 Some of the heads of the agencies, etc. to say, all right, what is it that that you can do to protect the Great Lakes, and I'll spell it, you know, and you've got a tribal representative here Homer Mendota from the northern Mississippi band, which is,
14:54:29 which had tribal land that was devastated by the Kalamazoo spell.
14:54:34 So, that body starts deliberating.
14:54:38 At this time, and I want to return to what Beth Wallace Beth was my colleague at NWF or she was there before I was, who had first kind of discovered this.
14:54:48 In the meantime, Beth had had taken another job she become a sustainability person at the Detroit zoo.
14:54:55 I am now working at NWF and bring that back because we've got, she's kind of the Erin Brockovich of this issue right she's like the person that's kind of exposing it and get it going and she comes back and the first thing she does is she looks like wait
14:55:09 a second.
14:55:22 We don't know if there's been oil spills in the Straits of Mackinac nobody is has looked for those. What we do know. What we do know is that oil has spilled all along this pipeline. In fact, there have been more than a million gallons of oil that's spilled online five right throughout this whole
14:55:27 right throughout this whole throughout this whole length, and she map there are at least 29 spills that were reported, and the reporting only goes back so far too I think it only went back to the 80s and the pipeline's been there since the 50s, and only
14:55:42 one of the spills was actually detected by the by Ambridge.
14:55:47 The others were detected largely if you look this is a big section of fairly remote parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan now some of it runs along a couple of the, the state highways there, and people will drive by and see oil.
14:56:00 I was basically the detection system. So how safe are knowing that you know what this crossing here of the streets. People are getting more, more and more concerned, some interesting things start happening.
14:56:15 A group of business leaders come together. Because what's happened is Enbridge at energy and I should back up and tell you just a minute about about Ambridge Enbridge is a company that I had never heard of before.
14:56:31 Prior to starting to work on this, but they're a big company in.
14:56:36 In Canada, they're a top 10 business and all of Canada.
14:56:39 There, you know, think of like Exxon Mobil or something but for for fossil fuel transport their pipeline company.
14:56:48 They've invested big money in this pipeline, the estimate is that what they make online five is approximately and we're talking profit so net of about $2 million a day.
14:57:00 So they're making about $700 million a year online five.
14:57:14 All right, they're moving, they're moving Well, now that's gone way down since the prices of oil have crashed the last six seven months so I don't, I don't have a more updated figure, but you get a sense of scale of what they do and they have now invested,
14:57:17 they're getting worked. We're getting worried because Governor Snyder has said, I actually want to figure out how to get this thing out of the water.
14:57:25 All right, and he started saying, I'm very concerned about this I want to get it out of the water, and they start investing really heavily in lobby.
14:57:34 So they have hired out now three major Lodge, Bobby firms in Lansing.
14:57:40 They've hired out to big PR firms in Lansing.
14:57:44 They've hired two people away from state government to lead their communications and lobbying efforts in inland right i mean they come in as a company that no one had really ever heard of there, and they get big gun guns their other businesses start going
14:58:04 Wait a second. Our voices aren't being heard and our businesses depend on clean water up there are businesses depend on tourism.
14:58:11 And in fact this group that you see here called the Great Lakes business network. It's a lot of breweries Bell's brewery. The biggest one in Michigan by long shots.
14:58:21 Larry bill helped found this great environmentalist shorts brewery which is up in North Northern Michigan Lake Charlotte boy brewery for really a very small one on Lake Charlotte boy which is also up in that up in that area.
14:58:36 I know you know this is a good pitch for nonprofit careers, I spent a hell of a lot of time drinking beer with cool people up in northern Michigan to help get this going.
14:58:44 I mean I spent a year or two and my main job was going out there, having a drink. The main thing I needed was like a designated driver, you know like having a drink with a bunch of breweries up there and getting people to join this network and sometimes
14:58:56 with Larry bell.
14:58:59 And people went went nuts for it like it became like a really big thing Patagonia joined it and but it was mostly smaller businesses.
14:59:07 Many some farms up their family farms joined up with this, and they basically said, We need our voices heard, on this as well. We actually create farmer jobs and bridge creates 250 jobs in the state, you know, Larry Bell said, I employ 1000 people myself.
14:59:25 I can't remember the exact number but there's something like 1000, he was like this one company's interest, shouldn't Trump bars. And by the way, there's only one Great Lakes and source of freshwater.
14:59:35 So it was very interesting this kind of organic group of Great Lakes businesses are now 150 of them and they're working on issues, not just online five, they got together and said you know our voices are rarely heard a positive voice on the environment
14:59:49 for businesses not very often heard in the halls of power.
14:59:54 You also had strong tribal interest that come out on this. Now there is one section of line five oh yeah, you can see it here that runs through that runs through tribal land.
15:00:07 You can't see line five on this but this is superior Wisconsin. This is the Michigan border that's what this line is here and this is Wisconsin and line five runs right through here.
15:00:16 And this here is actually the largest reservation east of the Mississippi it's called the bad River Band, and the bad River Indian Reservation. Beautiful, beautiful land, small tribe, 1800 people on the reservation, less than 4000 tribal members, overall,
15:00:34 large land area, I had the privilege of going up there last summer to meet with tribal members, and they call it the Everglades of the Great Lakes, because it's this massive wetlands comp complex.
15:00:45 So largest wildlife rice harvest in the entire. Great Lakes Area takes place here. And I would say, and you know, and there, and I have to be careful here that this it doesn't sound cliche but the tribal members have taken the best care and the best stewardship
15:01:02 of land that I've seen of any land managers. In my years in conservation. It's an amazing, amazing place line five goes right through there.
15:01:12 Now, line five has an easement to do that. That easement comes up for renewal, on the tribal, and the tribes say no.
15:01:27 The bad River Band passes a tribal resolution that says no.
15:01:26 In fact we want Ambridge off our land.
15:01:29 And they passed a resolution that essentially said Enbridge is now trespassing on our land.
15:01:36 And it's more complex like all things it's more complicated than that because it's not like there was like one easement. There are some easements that are held by the tribes themselves.
15:01:45 There are some that are held by individual tribal members. There are some that are held by groups, and all of them didn't want to renew the easement, but many of them did, and the negotiations went like this, tribes passed a resolution saying we want
15:02:00 you out. This is our travel and, and our entire culture and way of life is dependent on this, and then Brad said, Okay, how about $10 million.
15:02:09 They said nope, we want you out.
15:02:11 This is not not negotiable and Enbridge said how about $50 million, and they're literally publishing their offers in the local papers there.
15:02:19 And the tribes kept saying No no no, and they've now taken them to court to try and get them off their land.
15:02:26 It's horribly expensive for a tribe. This is not a well resourced tribe, they have a very small casino on their land. But this is now the tribe that's got large amounts of money to spend on legal cases we're helping to represent them that's how I've gotten
15:02:40 to know them our attorneys are, and in fact we, one of the things that NWF does is run the University of Michigan Environmental Law Clinic. And so we have law students in Michigan that are helping out with representation, and we've been battling Enbridge
15:02:54 for two or three years to try and get them off the land. So far it's still tied up in the courts. There's tribal interest in this too, if whatever just trying to do now.
15:03:05 They think they might lose, but they've bought up a bunch of rights to go around Ole Miss about 10 miles section here and now they're going to go probably 30 or 40 miles around it.
15:03:15 If they get kicked off that land, but they're that's what they're trying to do.
15:03:20 Okay. Now, the reason that Ambridge is allowed I talked to you about the easements on the tribal land. But the reason that Enbridge is allowed to operate under the Straits of Malacca, is an easement that they have with the state of Michigan.
15:03:39 Now this is an agreement signed in 1953. So think of it. Those of you who live off campus, right. So think of this as the lease agreement that sign.
15:03:49 Now, but then bridge paid a nominal fee at the time I believe it was $20,000, and there's no annual fees.
15:03:57 They actually are allowed to put their pipeline on the bottom of public lands the Straits of Mackinac, so this is like here on Lake Michigan together, unless they are in violation.
15:04:12 And in violation means they have to do certain things one, and most sort of importantly, but a little vaguely, they have to operate in the public interest, water, the great lakes are held in public trust, and it has to be deemed in the public interest
15:04:27 and operated with do care.
15:04:41 They also have this set of more specific provisions, such as the pipeline has to have coding around it. Think about it. You can't just have metal sitting in water for 67 years without a corrode so that supposed to have a layer of coding ground, it's actually
15:04:45 really toxic nasty stuff, not illegal in the 50s there's no way you can put that on it now, but that sits around, around the pipeline.
15:04:52 It's got to be supported so remember I said there were spans where it crosses the essentially the ancient riverbed in there has to be supported every 75 feet right because you can't just leave a pipeline that sagging in the water, the force 10 times again
15:05:06 that Niagara Falls but sometimes come in this way sometimes come in that way, right, and other provisions like that.
15:05:13 Here's the problem.
15:05:15 It turns out so we're now getting close to two years ago when the new governor came in.
15:05:22 We turns out that Enbridge is actually allowed it to sag. Not just 70 more than 75 feet but 210 feet unsupported spans.
15:05:33 All right, and our engineers said, doesn't matter if you support him now the damage has been done right has it been sagging like that for 67 years, we don't know.
15:05:44 They also know yeah here's, here's the, the supports piece. They also found out that there were other this that the coding was missing in particular places, it's really hard to see this in here.
15:06:01 Right. But you can you can get the best image they're not embraced had in their incentives.
15:06:08 In, you know if you're Ambridge, you're probably not going to release the clearest photo of this so it's a little hard to it's a little hard to tell, but this is where the coding has been scraped away.
15:06:19 The way I think I've got one more Oh the this a little better picture of it. It's still hard to tell but this is supposed to be like this, kind of like tar coding and other stuff but it's been it's been scraped away.
15:06:33 And they said oh no big deal. We'll just kind of patch it up and they said it's the size of a band aid.
15:06:40 It turned out it was.
15:06:43 Who was it three feet by five feet was some of the bigger marks. And there was this kind of amazing press conference that happened during the pipeline safety advisory board, where the head of the State Energy Agency who has a small child held up an Elmo
15:06:57 band aid and said, this is the size of a band aid then she held up something about three feet by five feet.
15:07:04 If you have that kind of band aid. That's not a band aid that's the ER visit, that's what's going on with line five right now. Right, so, so they're getting, they're getting ticked and we're getting concerned about what happens here.
15:07:16 It also comes out that there's really no way to recover oil, when it comes into the streets of Macedon. So the postcard is hauled up in front of Congress, Coast Guard is who responds to oil spills, and they say we are not simpler promise, which means
15:07:37 a fancy word for ready in lab, it's probably more than that but my translation is ready. And because look at that. So if there's an oil spill This is that that's a real picture right there's an oil spill there. How the heck are you going to get that.
15:07:45 How are you going to get there how you even to the know it. Right. When it's seeping underneath the snow and ice there and that's where the looks like again for months, months out of the end of the year.
15:07:59 So then we start looking into Well, what's actually in line five. Why is it there.
15:08:05 Right, why does it matter for the state of Michigan.
15:08:08 And it turns out that most of what's in line five so against oil and natural gas liquids, 80% of it is going from Canada to Canada.
15:08:21 So I told you is coming from largely from the tar sands up in Alberta. In Canada, and then it's coming through this map kind of shows it's at least up here, it's coming through here and this is Sardinia right sarnie Ontario bits chemical Valley, but most
15:08:36 of it is going like this it's going past here in this is Toronto, maybe it's getting off refineries in Toronto, but more of it's actually going to Montreal, and from Montreal, it can be export it through the St.
15:08:49 Lawrence Seaway up. And now, so you realize that you've got 540,000 barrels per, per day, which is the equivalent of 2500 tanker trucks or 688 railroad tank cars.
15:09:01 Each day coming through.
15:09:03 But, Michigan, the great lakes are being used as a shortcut for Canadian products to get to Canadian markets.
15:09:10 So what actually is used here.
15:09:12 Well we commissioned the study.
15:09:15 And there are three things that that line five provides. One is propane propane Michigan uses more propane than any other state in the country. Due to both the cold climate.
15:09:28 And the fact that you've got people it's almost all in northern Michigan in the Upper Peninsula, and you've got people that are pretty dispersed population there.
15:09:35 You don't have people in this, even the smallest cities they're often don't have central natural gas, so people have their propane tanks and that's how they heat.
15:09:45 About 1% of the product in line five gets off of line five in the Upper Peninsula at a place called rapid River.
15:09:52 And is it this is natural gas liquids, and it's turned into propane through a chemical process you can take natural gas liquids and basically take the propane out of it, and then distributed.
15:10:03 We looked at how would you do it without line five so this is what's happening now, and it costs about 61 cents per gallon right this is this is cost.
15:10:14 Well, you can actually take it from pipeline, and then take it by truck to rapid river cost you another 11 cents per gallon can do the same thing and do it by Oh by rail or by truck.
15:10:27 And it would cost a little bit more. Now propane prices tend to fluctuate by $1 or two per gallon per year, so people wouldn't generally notice that, but that amount 11 cents per gallon if you multiply that by the number of gallons that are used, it would
15:10:41 cost Michiganders about $3 million a year, seems like a lot of money but spread out over all the propane users, average family would pay $10 more.
15:10:51 So $10, you know, obviously not a lot, what we proposed was do this tactic, get it onto rail or truck and give everybody $20 in energy assistance, not just make up for the increased cost but make make it actually a little better.
15:11:07 Right. It also line five also has oil that is produced in northern Michigan so if you're up driving in northern Michigan you'll see kind of those old.
15:11:17 They call them the horse head oil wells you know the ones that you see kind of bobbing up and down like that. That's actually still producing oil. It's been declining but in place in northern Michigan and line five actually is how it gets to market.
15:11:29 So you have to replace that with train fortunately there's rails there that go directly down to where it's used which is in the marathon oil refinery in Detroit.
15:11:40 And that's the other thing it does it delivers crude oil to the marathon refinery.
15:11:44 That's the big oil refinery in Detroit if you driving up by 7530 credits that massive complex can't miss it. If you go to the only oil refinery in the state.
15:11:54 That actually is not a problem because it's fed by multiple multiple sources their oil pipelines coming from the south, coming from the east and coming from the west.
15:12:02 This is a small one coming from the north. So you've got different ways of doing because you know part of our advocacy was we didn't just want to say hey line five it's bad we actually wanted to propose the alternatives.
15:12:14 So, we're, we've put that out there in different ways now Ambridge is saying, hey, if you shut this down, planes are going to start falling from the sky gas is going to go up to go up to $5 a gallon and grandmas are going to freeze in the up right so
15:12:30 there's kind of a propaganda campaign going on. By Ambridge and that's why we put out what we hope was more unbiased information.
15:12:38 So this is all while this public body is deliberating.
15:12:43 And during that during that time, Governor Snyder starts negotiating with him Ridge, and we get this the, we get the state panel to actually vote to say, No, we need to shut down line five Michigan will be fine without it.
15:12:59 We need to shut down line five Michigan will be fine without it. Right. So we say all right we're going we're going to help line five for now. That's what your panel is doing.
15:13:09 Now, if you're a governor and you create a panel to give you advice, you actually don't want advice like that that you don't want to hear. And here's the next story Snyder rejects advice to shut down line five extends to deal with him.
15:13:16 He decides, I've got enough political pressure. But what I really want to do is keep most keep the whole land base pipeline in place, and I want to put the rest of it and the top.
15:13:27 So that's what the governor is trying to do.
15:13:31 During this time, right now we're back to two years ago I'm going to bring us back up to speed on the timeline pretty quickly here.
15:13:38 Line five is hit by an anchor.
15:13:40 This is kind of an amazing scary scenario this April 2018, and what happens is there is a ton boats unfortunately not a huge part so so the tug boat, and it wasn't their main anchor.
15:13:52 I learned more about shipping than I ever wanted to know there's multiple anchors on these things right. And somebody literally accidentally hit the wrong button.
15:13:59 Alright so they drop an anchor. It's a big enough boat and a small enough anchor, and it's in a big stormy, it's in a big storm in April, or this was like a huge spring store like think massive thunderstorms at sometimes roll through here in April, and
15:14:14 they drag the anchor, all the way from near maximal Island, all the way almost to Chicago, and the anchors pretty much gone by the time they get there it's just a little ball that's left, and it has bounced off of line five again hard to see but these
15:14:27 are the two kind of fluke so the anchor the bounce off, almost hook it which would have ruptured it. They also ruptured a electric transmission lines that went through the streets, they actually ruptured them and spilled some very nasty toxic stuff but
15:14:43 only 50 gallons of it, which in the Great Lakes Fortunately, my new quantity. Right. But this injects emergency. People are starting to get ticked off.
15:14:53 US Senator Gary Peters, hold hearings in Traverse City on this right it was kind of amazing we go up there so this is, I was called to testify with this this is Larry Bell the bell spur guy.
15:15:04 This is the Vice President of Enbridge and this is the head of the vice president of the American Petroleum Institute. And this is the labor union that works on this.
15:15:13 And he is just taking the test they had space for 200 people, 500 people showed up. This is how angry people are and they're coming at this, this, that I actually felt bad with this guy guy for members because we're sitting right there.
15:15:26 And he's literally shaking and he's going, Oh my God, look how many people are are here this is not as many people as I as I would have thought I thought, just a few people would show up, and I really didn't mean to be a jerk but just kind of came out
15:15:38 out of here and I was like, think that's better for me than you buddy, you know, and he was, he was the poor guy.
15:15:44 But I raked over the coals. What do you guys gonna do you know what is the thing that's going to happen and they said oh trust us. You said line five is as good as new day was.
15:15:56 So then we start getting into, like, what is the public actually want on, so we do some surveys, 87% of people are concerned this is the same polling that you see now the epic Mr a polls.
15:16:07 So when people talk about the free press and epic Mr a polls if you're like a political geek like me you've been reading these to see how Michigan is going to vote, potentially tomorrow.
15:16:17 This is the gold standard impulse This is the exact same polls. In fact, it was a it was, this was a poll from two years ago and the gubernatorial election where we added these questions, 87% say they're concerned about it, the spill.
15:16:30 And the majority, more than two to one margin say it's time to shut it down. They also say they're less likely support a candidate who supports line five.
15:16:39 So what's happening now. We got to get political on this because our current, the politicians at the time, are being particularly helpful. And we've got, at the time, former senator witness Witmer state Center, which is a candidate.
15:16:53 And we get her after a whole heck of a lot of back and forth, and a whole lot of work and a whole lot of powerful people talking to her, but she says I will immediately file to enjoin, the.
15:17:19 mine five anything short of that is insincere. That's huge. That's her saying I'm going to shut it down as soon as I'm an office data NASA current Attorney General of Michigan, long shot candidate who opened her candidacy for attorney general on the shores
15:17:24 of Mac the Straits of Mackinac say my number one priority if I'm elected Attorney General will be to shut down line five. I had never heard of data Nestle before that.
15:17:34 And she won.
15:17:39 Surprisingly, very very progressive cannon she's known she was actually I should have known who she was, she was the lead attorney that got that one the case that allow gay marriage to be legal in Michigan, 567 years ago whenever whenever that was, and
15:17:52 she's, she won his attorney general. She said she valid valid file on day one, to shut down.
15:18:00 They went.
15:18:02 What happens well Ambridge and Snyder, they say oh my god. We're about to be out of power.
15:18:07 So they cut a deal. They cut a deal that is requires the governor to keep line five in place while Ambridge builds a tunnel.
15:18:19 Doesn't say that Ambridge doesn't give a time for them to build a tunnel, they say basically as soon as you can, pretty please build a tunnel and put it in it.
15:18:28 Until then, line five must remain open.
15:18:32 So Whitmer on their first day in office says, Wait a second, I can't just shut it down because Governor Snyder is tied my hands, I need to figure out if I can knock out that law because it was unconstitutional the way it was passed, you're not allowed
15:18:48 the legal arguments don't really matter. But, but they start trying to knock out that ball.
15:18:53 But when we're also tries to negotiate with them rich, she comes in and says, You know what, I'm a reasonable person, but I really want to do is talk to Ambridge and see if we can reach a deal on a timeline for them to shut it down.
15:19:08 And she gets frustrated she says you know what they're not giving me a timeline they're just saying eventually will build a tunnel. And not only that, but here's what happens next.
15:19:17 Ambridge sues, the governor, the minute they walk away from the table to say that we want all the time in the world to build a tunnel, and we're going to keep it in the, in the water until those until those days.
15:19:33 The Michigan Attorney General, then files, a suit that says, All right. Your time's up.
15:19:39 We're revoking your ears.
15:19:42 So the legal battle is all right the legal battles been on the last the last year or two on this. The now so the two key things the Attorney General is suing to shut it down, Ambridge is suing to keep the law in place and to keep it open, saying the actions
15:19:56 by the Governor and the attorney general, are illegal, they are related but different suits. One of them is literally about building a tunnel. The other one is about shutting down the existing pipeline.
15:20:06 I know it's complicated I'd be glad to take questions but there's two, two different things on that.
15:20:12 And then Governor river says, we're going to figure out a way we're going to figure out a way to gather energy without losing line five, and we're going to figure out all the different violations that enriches had from this easement.
15:20:27 We're going to because Snyder kind of let it go, it's been let go for 67 years. No more, no more, it's time to figure out what they've been doing wrong.
15:20:36 In the midst of all this.
15:20:39 In the midst of all this and I know I'm running through it. This has been the creator have worked on a lot of advocacy campaigns. This one has unfolded and more twists and turns and anything I've ever seen.
15:20:48 You know I'm giving you the still long I know but the abbreviated version of it.
15:20:54 my five gets damaged again.
15:20:57 I'm fine pod gets hit by another anchor appears and other things. And it turns out so now we're up to June right so we're almost, we're almost two right in the present time.
15:21:09 It turns out that emerges own boats damage line five. They are hovering above line five right now they're trying to figure out if they can build a tunnel to replace it, and their own boats damage.
15:21:24 It gets shut down, at least temporarily during during this time, or it gets shut down temporarily.
15:21:32 During the during this time which is kind of amazing.
15:21:35 Now remember Enbridge had said if we shut down line five oil prices are going to climb planes aren't going to have the fuel they need.
15:21:43 People are going to freeze now it's June, so there's not as much propane use because it's almost all for heating and a lot of people have air conditioning running on propane that in the Upper Peninsula Michigan.
15:21:53 But none of that happens.
15:21:55 It's fine.
15:21:57 Now we are in fairness, we are in the midst of a pandemic when oil demand has also gone way down, and there's excess oil sloshing everywhere. If you view all are paying attention to the beginnings of the pandemic oil prices were below zero.
15:22:11 They went negative mean you had to pay someone to take the barrel of oil off your hands right because it's already been extracted, and it's just sitting there, or it's in tankers or it's in you know it's in refineries and storage tanks or or whatever.
15:22:25 But they, it gets shut down.
15:22:29 And we try and get the governor to make this shut down for good. The governor's shot or the judge shuts it down as part of the case against them that the attorney general filed.
15:22:40 but Ambridge gets the federal agency that oversees pipelines to say, oh, it might have been damaged.
15:22:50 And, you know, might have been your own boats that did it, but it's okay, open it back up.
15:22:57 Now remember I'm going to get political just for a minute. These agencies under President Trump as isn't really political this effect or under a minute, or under guidance to increase use of fossil fuels.
15:23:09 So we knew as soon as that the judge said the federal, we're going to get deference to the federal agency here, but the agency was very soon going to say it's okay.
15:23:18 And that happened there was it half capacity for about a month 45 days and then it went back to full capacity, but it did show one that the pipeline itself isn't safe, then bridges own boats are damaged.
15:23:31 And do I have the image here I kind of got cut off the image in the lower left you can see you can kind of see this is an anchor support that almost got knocked over.
15:23:40 Right, almost pulling the pipeline with it. Sorry I kind of put that picture but you get the. You get the idea.
15:23:45 And also, Michigan's just fine without it.
15:23:50 So then you got this huge battle moving forward about the tunnels. Right, so the tunnel, the battle for tunnels is heating up because you got any bridges and trying to move forward with the vine five tunnel that they have proposed, and they're trying
15:24:04 it through, get their permits, but then you've got geologists that say hey wait a second. We're not sure that the straits geology can sustain a tunnel in fact when they trail they did a test drilling into the bottom of the streets, the drill bit broke
15:24:18 off and floated and the drill but not only broke off and floated but floated back against and pushed against the pipeline.
15:24:27 I mean you've got like a wild in competence, or extremely difficult conditions or some combination of that going on.
15:24:35 And, you know, Ambridge is trying to do this, and they've got labor unions lined up behind it, or at least a decent amount of them. So us environmental groups have said, hey, it's time to get rid of this thing.
15:24:45 But labor groups and business groups, not the Great Lakes Business Network, but the American Petroleum Institute, much more powerful, even then the breweries are lined up behind this.
15:24:57 And so there's this tremendous pressure, and you've got these lawsuits right so there's five different lawsuits that two of them are still ongoing. Right.
15:25:07 This is the suit I was talking about with the Attorney General data Nestle verse Ambridge to shut it down, and the bad River Band verse average or other suits.
15:25:15 I won't go into the details we actually sued the federal agency over their decisions we settled and MIT got tougher standards we sued the Coast Guard.
15:25:25 Anyway, there are different things. This cracks me up because my, my 11 year old 12 year old toddler was helping me with this PowerPoint presentation this was her contribution she liked that picture.
15:25:38 So,
15:25:37 So just two more slides here.
15:25:41 We've got this is the state that we're in right now.
15:25:45 The governor is deciding whether she should just revoke this easement, the thing that she pledged to do.
15:25:56 She said anything else would be insincere. But she's been very hesitant to do this. I published an op ed.
15:26:04 About a month ago two months ago, that really talked it was called sincerity and governance and Governor Witmer.
15:26:10 If she was sincere about it. Why hasn't she done. What's holding her back, what is in the political realm is is holding it back. The governor's people were really pissed off at me for publishing and I was sort of in a, in a timeout not allowed to talk
15:26:23 to the governor's folks for for a little while because it's like, Wait, you said you were going to do this.
15:26:30 The legal hurdles have largely been cleared. It's actually time for the governor to take her stand on this. And I will say personally I have deep respect for governor Whitner the things that she has been through with the pandemic.
15:26:43 I think the way that she's handled it. And the way that she handled the kidnapping attempt all these different things on this issue though. She has not stood up and she hasn't followed through with what she said, and you've got businesses, you've got
15:26:56 environmental groups you got the tribal groups, urging the governor to shut it down this was from a press conference that we did just a couple of months ago.
15:27:05 And she has said, Oh yeah, sorry, one more thing that happens in between this was just from a couple of weeks ago.
15:27:12 To top it all off, and some of you might have seen this this was a big news story about three weeks ago, they found evidence possible ever evidence of an archaeological site right above where they're trying to drill the tunnel.
15:27:27 And this is from, let's see, boy, but you wouldn't you wouldn't think I teach and earth and environmental science because I've never actually taken geology, but it's it's something I think it was eight to 10,000 years ago, I could be off by you know 5000
15:27:39 years or so, but it was a while ago, when the Straits of Mackinac was a riverbed. Remember I told you there's kind of that deep V in the middle. This is what you see here is a picture of the side so what's underwater now was actually basically on the
15:27:56 side of the river, and was a big spot for Native Americans, hunting terrible. Or imagine, and they found what they believe are essentially rocks that service Hunting Blinds, for character.
15:28:11 It's really amazing it's in fact that I highly recommend there's a professor at U of M maybe some of you have even had classes with him, his name is john O'Shea.
15:28:18 He's a great lakes archaeology expert, specifically on tribal cultures and this he has a great TED Talk where he explains how this works. But what they think they found that to me, it looks like a bunch of algae covered rocks right, but they are arranged
15:28:32 in such a way that they believe that it is tribal hunting grounds that are now under the straits that would be there. And so they're stopping some of the permitting to figure out whether this is an archaeological site.
15:28:46 But back into the end here.
15:28:50 The governor says that the line five easement decision is coming in the very near future look at the date on that September 11.
15:28:59 So we are just under two months at one point she said probably before the election, don't think that's happening at this point.
15:29:06 But sometime very soon. She is going to decide what she's going to do and its decision before her decision before her His Will she side with the Attorney General and say, I need line five out of the Straits of Mackinac.
15:29:23 Now, or it's actually there's a there's a time window of several months, or, while she keeps hitting she hasn't done, she hasn't done anything on it yet.
15:29:39 She's tried to negotiate and or will she allow it to remain in place until or, unless a tunnel is built right that's the position that we're at right now.
15:29:43 And to me, you know, and we look back over time what's amazing I tracked this back to Beth was my friend and colleague who just a little bit older than you are now started this this whole thing by following her thoughts and passion and being really smart
15:29:59 and strategic about drawing folks in. Think about this, it was a one woman thing that she started when she employed a writer to help her with the report, she got she employed the University of Michigan raise some funds to do that to do some of the basic
15:30:11 research. She engaged with the tribal communities who eventually sued on tribal rights grounds and there's a whole nother lawsuit that might come out which is about travel fishing rights in the Straits of Mac and all that is where the seated treaty rights
15:30:25 for fishing center for the Native American cultures of the Grand Traverse and the little travelers, they banned of of Indians in northern Michigan.
15:30:36 She enlisted business support the Great Lakes Business Network now she now has a staff person working for her whose job it is to work with the Great Lakes business network and help them see their voice.
15:30:47 In fact, next week, myself and for other people will be sitting that well zooming with the governor to talk about what she's going to do about her decision, and we'll have the heads of some major businesses on this and carrying through letting the science
15:31:02 carry the day, and having that be leverage for the policy and action. So okay, I talked straight through that. I go back to my professor roots you wind me up and I can talk about this stuff forever but I'm going to pause there and see what kind of see
15:31:17 what kinds of questions or you know what what what do you all think if you were the governor, what would you be doing what would be going through your head now or, or what questions you have.
15:31:27 overall about this.
15:31:30 Hi, um, thank you for coming. I have like a couple questions. One is like, we're looking at Michigan like here I'm hoping it's not reversed for you, the riverbed, it's like the park going across this way or across this way.
15:31:43 It's going across the first way, so it's like, yeah, like perpendicular to the Mackinac Bridge. Correct. Okay. Um, and then for the like actual like governor like if I was the governor I obviously like, you know, there's a lot of stress right now do the
15:31:59 election and like line five like slipped my mind for a second, but like, you know, it definitely brought back that like line five stress for me like not to like add more onto the election, stress, but I definitely think that like I hope she can choose
15:32:16 to like get rid of it but also I know that she'd been having problems where she'd been getting blocked with every single thing she does by the Senate.
15:32:24 But like the Michigan senate so I'm hoping that even if she does like revoke the easement that they don't figure out a way to can, like, get it back in via the rest of the government and Michigan.
15:32:39 Yeah, so that's a that's a great, great point she has been blocked yes by the Michigan legislature and all kinds of things with this particular one, she does have clearly the administrative authority to revoke the easement right now, but the legislature
15:32:57 could mess with it and all kinds of ways and we were just trying to gain this I was, I was actually on the phone with the governor's environmental advisory this morning trying to game this out she was like how, what can the legislature do they could require
15:33:09 they could pass a law requiring granting of a new easement right now she has the authority, but the legislature has the power to take away executive authority on things like that.
15:33:19 Right.
15:33:20 They could cut a separate deal with them risk allows them to operate a different space. So, there are all kinds of creative ways that the legislature could do that now remember she can veto any of those things, too.
15:33:32 And it's not clear they do not the republicans do not have enough to override a veto. But Ambridge is allied with some Democrats, because some of the labor unions have been behind this a traditional democratic constituency.
15:33:46 And so they have been very.
15:33:49 Some of the democrats are aligned with Ambridge in wanting to build a tunnel least. And so there is a question of whether they have enough to override a veto in the Senate, that there's a super majority of republicans but there's not in the Michigan house,
15:34:07 they hold a majority by three. Right now, so not anywhere near enough to override a veto. So those are those are great questions. So that's, that's part of what's been rolling around, I'm sure in the governor's head.
15:34:16 Hi, I'm. Thank you so much for coming. I'm jumping off of that point do you think there's a chance. She's waiting until the election happens to get more political candidates and on her side.
15:34:31 This, this is probably going to be a really big turnover you're crossing my fingers at least for candidates so I feel like waiting a bit might get her the backing that she needs to feel like there's been a lot of political opposition to her especially
15:34:45 in response to coded in that.
15:34:48 Yes, exactly. So I do think that she is waiting for the election.
15:34:54 Be for one key reason and it's back to the labor unions, her job. I mean, you know, if you're the governor right now your job probably one through 10 is keeping as many Michiganders of live as possible.
15:35:05 I mean let's be honest about priorities here, right.
15:35:08 I think she also sees it as her job of delivering Michigan for Biden, and for us senator Gary Peters, and she is worried that in that if she just, you know, speculating but it doesn't take very foreign.
15:35:24 To do this, she's worried that if she moves hard on the issue where the labour constituency goes one way and the environmental community goes another.
15:35:39 Those are the two probably strongest core constituencies for democrats that she splits off support either for Biden and or center Peters.
15:35:42 And so I would expect the governor, what we'll find out as soon after the election, whether she's really willing to make her move because that would be the time to do it.
15:35:51 If she thinks it's not politically advantageous but it's the right thing to do, the perfect time to do that is in November December this year, because by the time she's up for reelection two years from now, frankly, it's not going to be on people's radar,
15:36:04 how long you know like scandals go away in a matter of days like people aren't gonna be thinking about this as much as I would like two years from now, though, there will be issue after issue, and she won't have hard, you know it's either states either
15:36:15 going to go for Biden or not, it's either going to go for Peters or not. And you know the the other thing that's in play right now is that Michigan Senate is not up for election, they're on a four year cycle, and they're all up on the midterm election
15:36:31 years, and Michigan house is right now the democrats are on the offensive, and they think that they have a chance a strong chance to take over the Michigan house and put it in democratic control.
15:36:41 So I think those things are our reason for her to be cautious about this.
15:36:48 If I were political advisors IB urging some caution that is under the assumption that you don't think it's politically advantageous. We have been trying to show her and her team data that's actually advantageous to take bold action on this, you'll be
15:37:09 rewarded at the voting booth, but I don't think she fully bought buys it.
15:37:09 Other questions I'm looking in the chat box here.
15:37:12 I'm problem. Oh yeah, so you answered the question on on Prop one yep different, different issue land, land, land conservation.
15:37:21 So, Mike, I actually I'll jump in if nobody else has a question which is
15:37:27 like let's if we were to set aside some of the geological questions about whether or not a tunnel could actually be feasible in the streets. Do you feel like if it were to be installed that it would be a.
15:37:44 It would be a safer way to transport the petroleum across the streets, or are there other issues that would still be president right even with the tub.
15:37:55 And there's a question that I have thought long and hard about that.
15:37:59 Here's the thing, If you could magically put in a tunnel. Tomorrow, you know if you can just snap your hands in the tunnel would appear. There is no question in my mind that that is a safer way to get water across the streets.
15:38:12 I mean, just think about it you want it, buried beneath the water so if there is a spill it doesn't go up it goes down, obviously, right so there might be problems with an aquifer but it's a whole different thing than polluting the lakes themselves.
15:38:27 But there's a few problems. One is that the building of it is a, is a dangerous activity for the lakes, and it's, it's also it, they have to actually take out a bunch of land on particular on the south side so near near maximal city, because they basically
15:38:46 have to create a big waste site.
15:38:49 When you're tunneling it's a 10 foot diameter tunnel that goes five miles. Think of all the materials that comes out for that. So they're creating basically a landfill there, and some of what's going to come out of there is hazardous waste too.
15:39:03 So you've got those issues, and they do it, it has to be done in a wet environment I mean think about that if you're rotating something in it. As you're drilling that's how they're drilling without some water there you're going to generate so much heat,
15:39:15 you're going to cause fires, right from all the friction. So it's done in water so you have this slurry of sometimes toxic material that's coming out while you're building.
15:39:26 And I worry about that contaminating Great Lakes themselves and there's no good way to, to contain that you build you build like a sledge pond, essentially.
15:39:34 The other issue is, what happens to the other parts of line five that have been poorly managed right so Ambridge is not putting the maintenance for the 540 miles that are on land.
15:39:47 Because I think they're not sure whether they're going to be able to continue to operate. So you saw is that uncovered is my colleague Beth was walls and currently has been over a million gallons leaked.
15:39:57 Well, so if you fix the problem. If quote unquote fix it and put it under the Straits of Mackinac, I think it's very unlikely to leak at that point, the probability of a leak goes down to almost zero, I actually agree with him on that point.
15:40:11 If it leaks, a half a mile away, and the tributary that dumps it directly into the Straits of Mackinac on, you actually have the same problem.
15:40:19 And so there's the land based problems now what I said, and I was able to say this directly to Governor Snyder, and to Governor Whitman or if you require them to replace the entire land based segment.
15:40:42 It's an all new pipeline. It's a bigger pipeline to. They replaced the entire thing. That's much better, you know, the technology has changed over the last 67 years, and just over time pipelines where now.
15:40:50 If they replaced all the land base segments and the tunnel, you would have a very safe pipeline from a water perspective, but I'll throw on the last wrinkle.
15:40:59 That doesn't help you from a client perspective.
15:41:02 I also think or I know that if we keep extracting tar sands oil at the rate that we're doing, or cooked from a climate standpoint, and this is how Sierra, my group tends to approach it from a water quality standpoint, because that that's actually the
15:41:16 best way from a political standpoint to get it done. Sierra Club approaches it, and I have deep respect for them and agree with this from a climate standpoint, saying, we just need to be removing oil pipelines.
15:41:26 We keep that there were creating a pathway for for greenhouse gas emissions. So that's that that's my nuanced sort of complicated answer to that is that we might wind up with a much safer way to transport through water with the tunnel.
15:41:43 That's one potential outcome.
15:41:46 But it doesn't solve the climate problem. I also think it is no longer allowed to operate the pipeline, while they're building the tunnel, which is if the government takes the action that I hope she will take would say yep you're shut down now once you
15:42:02 build a tunnel you can restart.
15:42:04 I think Enbridge walks away.
15:42:06 If you're Enbridge, do you invest a ton is going to cost him about a billion dollars you invest a billion dollars for something that will probably be open for five years from now, for a declining market for oil and natural gas, I don't, I don't know that
15:42:21 you do that and we've had some financial analysts say, No way. Because what will happen is they'll think the companies that still want the oil and natural gas, they'll find alternative ways to get it, they're not just gonna be sitting there for the next
15:42:33 four or five years waiting for a tunnel to be built. So by the time it's done, whether you can be demand for the, for the oil, and you're not getting that revenue stream of 700 800 million a year.
15:42:44 You know that makes an attractive offer the tunnel will have already paid for itself by the time it's built.
15:42:50 So those are some of the factors.
15:42:55 Other questions for Mike.
15:42:58 Yeah, I had a question. Thank you for coming.
15:43:01 I was just wondering, because 80% of the wind five is going to Canada from Canada. I was just like wondering about the role and responsibility of the Canadian government and if they like having saying this or would have to cover any costs from damages
15:43:20 or replacement or anything like that.
15:43:23 Yeah, so the role of the Canadian government has been fascinating in this, because they have you know they're they're stronger on climate change, than we are in climate change protections you know climate change laws.
15:43:38 They're also though, more dependent on fossil fuel extraction as a percentage of their economy in the US is right so they've got kind of this interesting dual role.
15:43:50 Right now, though, if you're the Premier of Ontario.
15:43:53 This is a good deal for you.
15:43:56 It is because the oil is not going nearly as much through your province, think about it if it went north around Lake Superior to the north, which is an option.
15:44:06 Or could I mean technically technically it's an option.
15:44:09 They decided not to do that in 1953, because one it adds about 150 200 months, the shape of Lake Superior it goes way far northeast, you know it's a huge body of water.
15:44:22 Too much more remote. I mean, it makes the up look like it's a very populated area compared to what's on the north side of Lake Superior right so it's much more remote and much harsher climate.
15:44:34 You're in the snowbelt of Lake Superior.
15:44:37 And so, the Canadian government the Ontario government has actually weighed in and said, Hey line five is good just leave it in place, please. I mean that's basically been their stance.
15:44:48 Trudeau Prime Minister of Canada has, has been kind of lukewarm, he's tried to stay out of it it's a problem for him because it goes against his, his agenda to combat climate change, but he's got some very strong business interest in favor of it.
15:45:04 So he's been sort of quiet, whereas in Ontario, who now has a very conservative premier to. They've been all for it. In fact, they have threatened to invoke some sort of international law.
15:45:17 If it shut down.
15:45:19 So it's, I shouldn't share this but in talking with some governor witness people as I said what about Canada and they were like, oh, when is the US cared that much about Canada's opinion, you know that that was kind of their that was kind of their reaction
15:45:30 you know like they're not really for it but that's not really what shapes our decision, you know they're not they, they're weighing in but in, in, in fact, obviously Canada doesn't have any legal recourse directly over decision in state waters.
15:45:45 They do it for the parts of line 595 also has an international cross. Right. So how does it get back to Canada. Well where the blue water bridge, if you know where that is from from Michigan so what's right.
15:45:57 Do the thumb yep and retry here at the base of the thumb, where Port Huron is in Sanya line five crosses back into Canada there, but we're talking to river, I don't know exactly how wide it is, it's not a very wide river, and it tunnels underneath, it's
15:46:12 not in the river itself.
15:46:14 Right, but that crossing candidate does have a sheet, say because it's an international crossing. It doesn't in the straits. I mean I don't understand quite what they're saying under international law, but essentially they don't have a role in it because
15:46:26 it's a crossing of water that state. The state or with a interesting in from Michigan.
15:46:33 Good question. I think it was Emily, good question.
15:46:36 Yeah. Thank you.
15:46:41 Other questions.
15:46:48 I think for me, I know coming into michigan. 2014, not knowing about line five was, like, terrible. I was supposed to know all about this particular issue.
15:47:00 And it was like everybody knew because there was a sensitization with Kalamazoo oil spill.
15:47:06 And I'm just wondering, in some of these I know you mentioned that poll, but in like general sort of like surveys, what are some of like the common, you know if 66% of Michiganders are for stopping and removing the pipeline.
15:47:20 I'm kind of wondering what the other 33%. What is that like, what are they arguing for keeping I know I've heard that propane.
15:47:29 In the up or marathon oil, but I'm wondering Are those the only issues is there anything else that is because this isn't.
15:47:38 It's not something pretty, right, like you're not going to be like bound when we've talked about say with some of the dam removal or whatnot like this isn't something like any sort of cultural type connection or some like that and so I'm just wondering
15:47:49 what some of the opposition is for stopping or for removal on that you've heard.
15:47:55 Yeah, it's mostly it's mostly what you, you said but it's. They've made. They made a jobs argument.
15:48:02 And there may not be that many jobs I said that Ambridge employs approximately 200 people on line five and about 200 Online 78 so about 400 direct, indirect employment you know for each job there's other folks who are generally employed on the service
15:48:16 side either directly as contractors or say the restaurants or whatever that are near near them you could get that number up to 1000. That's a pittance compared to the state.
15:48:27 However, in the, this is largely in really small communities, you have 500 shops in your town of 300. That's a big deal.
15:48:37 Ambridge also does not pay any tax to the state of Michigan, but they do pay local property taxes. There are some places in the up in particular where Ambridge is revenues are pretty big chunk of their school budget, for example.
15:48:52 So there are there are some real issues, even though the scale of it's pretty small overall, because the scale of the communities that they're in is small.
15:49:02 I think that's where you're finding if you go up to Northern Michigan maybe you've seen this you, you've got pro and anti line five signs and almost equal proximity, depending on where you are.
15:49:13 And the pro signs, it says something like, you know, jobs, jobs from line five or, you know, and they're basically, but they also say there's kind of an anti environmental environmental backlash I think that you'll find is pretty strong and some of the
15:49:42 sectors of the state so saying, Oh environmental extremists want to stop. You know, they want to shut down our cars again, I would say along the lines of what you have how you heard Trump characterized Biden's climate plan. Right, so that is also the way
15:49:45 Ambridge has characterized opposition to line five. And that takes red hold with well roughly a third of the state.
15:49:56 So I want to see that we're only a minute till we have the class so I just wanted to make sure that we all get a chance to thank Mike for coming today.
15:50:03 Lots of interesting things were discussed so please give them some virtual applause.
15:50:11 We definitely appreciate his breasts.
15:50:14 Thank you for having me.
15:50:18 And we will get together on Wednesday and talk about bottled water whole other giant issue.
15:50:30 Thank you. Thank you.
15:50:33 Great job. Great job, Michael.
15:50:35 That was.
15:50:36 It was cool to hear the updates. Oh, he's gone.
15:50:41 So, I'll see you Wednesday.
