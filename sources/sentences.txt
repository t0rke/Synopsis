so we will get started in just a couple minutes guys and girls
try to hide all these windows so you dont see as much junk on your screen
oh i can just see that so we know where my brain needs to go perfect
alright gang okay welcome back
what do we have the fifth week
just keep trucking along
so just as a reminder i think a lot of the groups have uploaded their pictures for the sample size if you havent done that with your captions please do so
i think there might have been some strange language in the canvas instructions that asks you for some things but your photos and the captions are thats fine
we dont need to shop jeff question
im having a hard time here today i guess so
any questions about that before we get going
hopefully everybody got a chance to visit some of the sites or talk to the group members who visited some of the sites and it was a nice weekend so wasnt too bad
so were going to continue our discussion of water infrastructure today if you have a couple of guest speakers that have graciously agreed to come and chat with you all are
jen lawson she is the water resources manager for the city of ann arbor for the almost years now hard to believe and jen has a background in land use and environmental planning and she also got her masters in landscape architecture from university
michigan so michigan connection and we also have sarah page with us sarah is the drinking water quality manager for the city of environment just over two and a half years or turn right around there
and sarah has a phd in environmental and aquatic chemistry from the university of minnesota and she has studied a bunch of different stuff including our global blooms in lake erie and also done some consulting work on emerging contaminants
so these are lots of questions thats come up from the group so theyll have plenty of good questions for you as im sure so with that ill turn it over to jen and shes going to give us a little overview of the water system
oh
its hiding
so do a sound check good yes nod your notes okay thank you guys
well thank you for that wonderful introduction
my role at the city of ann arbor is very cross departmental and i have up here on the screen water systems and in arbor
but its drinking water its stormwater its sanitary sewage and its the natural river that runs through the city of ann arbor or here on river theres a lot of interconnection with those waters
and thats kind of the role as the city municipality has to play but theres a few other players that are also going to be listed
im going to talk more about the the infrastructure the pipes the things you can kind of see or the things that are underground sarah is going to come in and talk about how we use the water how we make the water and then more of those as as jason
mentioned the emerging contaminants the issues that we have to deal with with water distribution
so much technology
there we go
so the city of ann arbor is very fortunate to have one of the leading stormwater programs in the entire great lakes region not just in stormwater management but in green infrastructure bioengineering and utilizing stormwater more as an amenity as opposed
to just kind of putting into pipe in getting rid of it
many times
many times when people look at the city of ann arbor they think of the city of ann arbor with its freeways the major roads kind of going through some people maybe think about the river flowing through it
but i think about it this way i think about it with not just the river but all of those creeks and tributaries that flow through and collect all of the stormwater runoff from our community going a step further we have several creek sheds in the city
of ann arbor that we focus a lot of our efforts on
and i had alluded a little bit to different jurisdictions some of these creek sheds are actually what are called county drainage districts which means the county water source commissioners office also has a say in how to maintain or and or manage those
screenshots
so specifically in the city of ann arbor we have allen creek which is under downtown its over impervious and if you think about all the buildings and streets and all the roads that you see in downtown ann arbor
thats half of the range is going right to the river without any treatment
you have maliks creek on the southern end of town thats the largest creek shed in town its about of the land area and its about impervious again so theres a lot of rain water that falls that goes directly to the river without any treatment
traver creek and honey creek and swift run creating are also county drains so they have established county drain districts and theres a multiple jurisdictional management the ones that are a little bit unique millers creek is not the county drain
does however collect a lot of campus kind of north nearside campus as well as the default ncr and crcvncrv youll find their property
and then fleming creek is not a county drain either
but when it comes to management of who owns those creeks waterways pipes underground the city of ann arbor owns a majority of them sitting in over actually owns all of the green ones showing up on the screen
interspersed with those are the bright blue ones in the middle the university actually owns their own stormwater collection system as well depositing directly into the here on river
the red lines are the county drain so those are the actual established channels for each of those county drains and then theres a few interspersed purple ones and yellow ones
those are privately owned not under our jurisdiction theyre actually enter jurisdiction of the state of michigan
when it comes to pipes underground though theres a lot of really interesting facts some people dont really think about the pipes underground and thats what i get to do every day
the citys stormwater has a majority of the system that was built before the vietnam war in fact was even installed before the korean war we have some pipes and ground that were that are over years old
that doesnt mean theyre bad
that just means that theyre old pipes and infrastructure were built a very differently years ago they were much thicker the user different hiring process
but that does mean that we kind of have to think a little bit about the longevity of pipes how well is a pipe built and how long is it going to last
so this table is telling me that we have miles of pipes of storm water pipes in the city of ann arbor
thats not including all of the open channels and the drains and the creeks and the ditches because those all also can be stormwater as well if you include all of those numbers were responsible for miles of pipe
im thinking about that number though if you had a kayak in the city of ann arbor just basically on creek area
and you kind of hacked in a pie plate end to end to end you could get almost all the way to the city of chicago just in our storm water pipes
we have four guys in our public works department that manage all of those pipes
not enough guys wed love to have a few more
but thats a lot of pipe that we have to maintain maintain and manage and thats just the stormwater system i havent even talked about the other systems
so the city man arbor has a separate storm sewer system its not unique in the city or the state of michigan however we are very fortunate that it is separate
that means that our sanitary sewage does not commingle like city of detroit for example or some of your larger urban communities they have whats called commingling within the pipe
that also means that all of their rainwater goes through a treatment facility before it gets dumped into the river we dont have that in ann arbor every drop of rain that falls and goes into the storm drain goes directly to the huron river or it goes
through a detention base in or goes through a rain gardner goes through a bio swale none of the rain water that falls is sent to the treatment plant
but im going to switch gears now
this is the sanitary sewer
we talked about rainwater lets put put a pin in that
this is what i lovingly call the pool water and youre talking to toddlers you can make it fun
this is an example of actually a grease clog in the sanitary sewer system
this is grease and roots and all other sorts of things that you flush down the toilet you flush down your disposal in your sink
this is what ends up in the sanitary sewer system
we have miles of sanitary pipe
its more pipe than stormwater its still a lot of pipes that we do have to maintain and manage much of that pipe also is hundred years old years old
were not installing a whole lot of new sanitary pipe because the majority of our pipe was installed when an arbor grew postwar s s and s
they were managing that older pipe as well
all of that sanitary sewer goes to our wastewater treatment plants this is on the downstream end of ann arbor opposite sarah whos at the upstream end of an arbor
this is where all of the sanitary sewage is treated and then discharge back into the here on river
drinking water is another system that i had mentioned this is the drink yes is actually on madison i believe this is installation of new drinking water main that was being installed probably four or five years ago looking at the guys that are in the
picture
but this is what happens when you dont take care of some of those pipes underground
there could be catastrophic incidents
this is actually a park in the city of ann arbor that was completely destroyed by a water main break
and it was a pipe that went directly underground that we know is there but sometimes things happen theres free saw theres theres pressure theres hydraulic jumps
oftentimes you see this out in the field
these guys actually are walk working on a water main break but its the same yellow truck its the same public works guys all of our guys are cross trained and so they can work on any of those utility infrastructure projects at any time
so if theres a massive water main break we can send all of our crews out there
if you see them please say hello thank you goes a long way just saying
whats really important though when we think about drinking water in the city of ann arbor is that it provides a part of the community and the culture zingermans uses it for stuff at their deli many of our beer breweries use it
we use it for medical research we use it the university uses it for laboratory and it also provides all of the water for football games theres a big drastic jump on football saturdays when we look at water usage in town
theres a lot of water that goes into maintenance of that stadium as well
we can talk about numbers a little bit i told you guys i kind of look at the numbers in the data behind things are drinking water mains again this is the distribution system this is not all of the smaller little pipes to that go to hydrants and that
kind of thing
but we have roughly four im sorry miles of drinking water distribution fight
thats all of the red that you see whats not included in this map is the university whose university also has a drinking water distribution system that they maintain and manage and it does is connected to our system
another way thats really fun to look at the data is looking at installation dates
if you look at the very center of the downtown area
it was installed in the s to the eight to about
again many of those pipes are over years old but that doesnt mean that its bad because pipes were made differently they were made thicker
we dont have as many problems on the older pipes as we do on more of the pipes again in the s s metal was expensive and it was very
it was more about lets build the city as opposed to lets take our time
so as you look out kind of in this ring around town the green light green the light blue is what we saw basically from
a majority of our system is in the s for installation
whats interesting about water distribution specifically drinking water distribution system is that there are different materials used which you see much more of a difference than those other utilities i mentioned before s it was solid cast iron
and then post war cast iron changed because all of that iron that was used for world war two
they were looking for cheaper ways of manufacturing i mentioned the pipe with the pipe im sorry the thickness got smaller after the war they didnt use as much iron in their pipes
then we switched to concrete pipes we switch to ductile iron pipe
thinking long term though so i mentioned the storm water system i mentioned the sanitary sewer system i mentioned the drinking water system
we also have to manage this at the city of ann arbor thats where we come in so the group that i work in as the systems planning unit and its engineers and scientists that are collaborative and holistic in their planning
so its not your typical planning department its not your typical engineering department
were a group of people who look at the entire system using data using framework models using gis geospatial information as well as public engagement and that when you think about it from a scientific standpoint doesnt sound as exciting but so much
of the communities that you work with
they think a lot about how their water tastes whats the pressure of the water coming out of their faucet is the water clean enough to go fishing swimming kayaking boating and especially in ann arbor theyre very engaged very engaged in community issues
but you see this so much in some of your larger communities
so thinking about data we have instantaneous usgs stream gauges that are around town minute much much of this data is available online off of the citys website and so its all publicly available data we dont charge for it
we pay for the data collection and then we make it available to whoever wants it so we can at any given time see how fast the rivers flowing how fast our creeks for flowing
whats the discharge rate
several of them look at dissolved oxygen several of these meters look at the ability to measure us
we also have rain gauges around town that are minute tipping buckets so its exactly what it sounds like its a little tiny bucket in five different locations including on top of city hall that every minutes it dumps
and we measure how much water was in that bucket and we can pinpoint we can look at entire days weeks months or we can see how intense a storm was or what the duration of a specific storm was because we recognize that the rain does not follow the
same in the city of ann arbor sometimes you get a ton of rain on the north side and no rain on the south side sometimes all the rain stops at the west side and its completely dry on the east side but we dont know that when you listen to channel seven
or channel four and they say oh everyone got an inch of rain
we recognize that thats not true and thats not how science works so we have these gauge systems around the city again this is all available online for the citys website
weve been doing a lot of comparisons with flow monitoring specific to stormwater and hydrology graphs to look at how upstream improvements for development or for city projects or for private projects can reduce the flow or reduce the downstream impacts
and what were trying to see is lowering that peak of the hydra graph
we dont do this for every storm water project but we do it for ones that we know are going to be a large capital investment or if theres a very very keen public interest in it with the watershed council or with one of our other groups and groups
it kind of goes insane without saying were looking for the science and data to show the improvements and almost validate what were working on for our capital improvement projects
one of the metrics that we look at in the city event or were specific to storm water is imperviousness
i mentioned those creek shifts that we have in town
we look at impervious area procreation because we recognize that theres kind of a land use pattern that works that falls within several of these creatures areas
the number doesnt always go down the number might go down and we dont measure it
the way we get this information for impervious areas is every three years we have a flyover done of the city with color infrared photography looking for impervious cover and leave off conditions so the tree canopy cover and we can calculate that by
personal so we overlay this data so we can start looking at where are there are improvements are where are there opportunities for improvements as i mentioned ellen creek and melons creek or the highest by far
theyre also the most developed by far
we cant take out downtown
cant take out brighter wood mall we cant take out some of these larger apartment developments but what we can do is look for opportunities within those developments maybe their stormwater islands within a parking lot maybe its a green roof green
roof certainly addresses the impervious cover because it does up take some of that storm water
whats really great about this though is that its a long term measurement that we can start making i dont know that the needle is going to move super quick
id love to say that maybe by the time i retire in some odd years maybe some of these numbers will have gone down by a percent
it took us and so many years hundred and years for in order to grow into what we have now and now were managing and fostering those resources that have been left for us
so with that im actually going to stop and pause
thats a really high overview of our utility systems i could probably talk for an hour about sanitary sewage which is really exciting you know an hour about poop
i could talk an hour about drinking water i could talk now about stormwater if you have further questions were certainly available but i am going to turn it over to sarah so she can kind of hone in on some of the specific issues around drinking water
know where to go back to switch
to your question drags boy
yeah i got real
okay can you hear me is this working of it okay
i certainly never expected to have this job i didnt have any idea actually that this job existed
all the time i was doing my studies so i basically studied carbon cycling in the arctic
for most of my phd work and then ended up somehow doing a postdoc here at the university of michigan actually in this building with rose corey looking at harmful algal blooms in lake erie so i was out on lake erie
in when the algal bloom was so bad that it shut down the toledo water intake and i was i mean it was literally out on the boat taking samples thinking theres this whole community that doesnt have water because of this
this phenomenon that im studying what if i could do something actually to help with the water versus just sort of trying to understand i guess i was more interested in application so
so i made the switch and became a consultant and spent three years working with a wide array of a wide array of utilities around the country
and really found the area of emerging contaminants to be fascinating so i ended up sort of specializing in emerging contaminants and optimizing water treatment processes for emerging contaminants
it ended up that i wanted to actually be able to make my own decisions as a consultant what you you can do the best work that you can and then its totally up to your client if they actually do anything about it
and so i ended up coming to ann arbor to be the water quality manager and i have to say its been really great
i have a water treatment plant that does chemistry on a scale that i still sometimes cant believe we can treat up to million gallons of water per day
and we have a very complex process i think the fortuitous thing is that we ended up p fos sort of exploded about three or four months after i came on board
so it turns out that all of my experience with emerging contaminants actually ended up being used although we obviously had no idea that that was going to happen when i was hired
so with that i want to talk a little bit i mean i want to talk about drinking water treatment in ann arbor and then im going to talk about some of the emerging issues that we face
so we have two sources of water for our water treatment plant we have
yes lets see can i use the mouse to point
okay so we have an intake at the huron river right at barton pond we get about of our water from there and then we have some groundwater wells
here at the municipal airport so the water from both of these sources is pumped up here to the water treatment plant
we soften the water and ill show a process diagram on the next slide but one of the things that were that im actually very proud of is that we are constantly monitoring our source water the treatment process and then the water out in the distribution
system to make sure that the water that we the water that were producing and that were providing to our customers is safe so we take almost discrete chemical measurements every single year
so every hour of every day were taking measurements we also have a lot of online instruments so that doesnt actually even include sort of any of the online like turbid meters and flow meters things like that
so actually thats one of the opportunities i guess i see in the field of water is that we have a lot of data and we dont necessarily have the tools to use this data
the way that i think we could i think that there are many issues that we face and we have the information but we need more data science tools actually to to be able to process the data
i routinely max out excel just trying to pull in data and analyze it so thats just my plug for data science
im looking at our treatment process we have to stage softening so the river the river water goes through both stages of softening and the well water primarily goes through only the second stage of softening
and
the reason that its really important that the river goes through both stages of softening is that thats one of the ways that we really clean the water we remove all of the particles were removing bacteria viruses through that softening stage
and were also obviously softening the water so the water in the harbor area is very hard in the river we average a hardness of about milligrams per liter
and in the wells were averaging five to
milligrams per liter of hardness and just for reference you would feel like a water was fairly soft or like comfortably soft when its probably in like the to range
so our water is very hard and thats actually the primary reason that the the ann arbor established a water treatment plant because they were taking well water and injecting it straight into the system and it was basically plugging everything up because
of the really high levels of hardness so we have this softening plants that removes the hardness that also removes a lot of the particulates it removes organic material
and from that second stage of softening then we go straight into our ozone disinfection and we use ozone as our primary disinfectant
the great thing about ozone is that it pretty much reacts with everything
the other thing about ozone is that pretty much reacts with everything and so you get a residual for about minutes so its not a long lasting disinfection but it is a disinfection that gives us the basically kills the bacteria and virus and cryptosporidium
that we need so we have ozone
then we have biologically active regular activated carbon filters and the reason that these filters are biologically active is partially because bacteria really love carbon thats like a really great media for them to grow on so actually any carbon filter
that you have has bacteria growing at it i can guarantee it
but the reason that its particularly important to us is that ozone breaks carbon up into little small pieces that bacteria really love
and so if you dont remove those before you send the water out into the distribution system you end up having a lot of bacteria growing in your water pipes which are for obvious reasons is not desirable
so we have these biologically active carbon filters which ill talk a little bit more about later but i like to think of these filters as the heart and soul of our process so theyre working for us and that theyre physically streaming the water
theyre also chemically absorbing compounds like the carbon is a really good media for absorbing things and then they have the bacteria that are also removing removing compounds and eating things so that is our filters and then as i mentioned previously
the ozone disinfection only last up until the filters and then we have this water that has been filtered but we need to disinfect it before we send it out into the pipes because it needs to still be safe to drink up to days later when it gets to customers
sort of at the far reaches of the city so we use a combined chlorine and chloramines
and thats the disinfectant that we use it has a lot of benefits if you do it right its tasteless so detroit on the other hand uses pre chlorine and so a lot of you can really tell the difference
honestly between the two if you do a side by side smell test the detroit water is going to smell a little bit more like a swimming pool and in our birds water should really smell like nothing
we recently did a project actually to add uv disinfection to our treatment plant
there were some updated rules and we needed to add additional disinfection based on levels of cryptosporidium in the river so that uv treatment just came online in july
so jen hit some of these highlights but the water service area that we have is about square miles and we serve a population of approximately
i mentioned that our treatment plant can treat up to mtd but on average were only using
mtv of that capacity and thats partly because we need to be able to treat water to the highest possible demand in the hottest possible year with the least amount of rain and also theres fires
so you need to be able to to
thats what you design your system to is sort of the extreme case of need and then you often end up using much less of that capacity than
then you have we have a bunch of storage tanks around the city you probably seen our two water towers theres one out by county farm park and then one on north campus we do sell to silo township and in arbor township
and we have a bunch of different pressure districts and arbor is not flat
and that when you are distributing water the best thing is for the water to flow downhill by gravity so thats part of the reason that the water treatment plant is located up on water hill its the second tallest spot in the city so were able to feed
that whole central central downtown district just with gravity the water just flows out of the treatment plant but for all of these other locations we actually have to pump the water to increase the water pressure to serve to serve those areas
so thats sort of the overview of the water of water treatment and now i want to get into two emerging contaminants the first one is one for dioxane and this is a this i would just like to point out we have actually a lot of information available
and even in the past month there have been some developments in terms of the litigation
so if you just go to the water treatment website we have all of the links available im actually not going to cover the litigation thats
thats really just not my area of expertise what im here to talk about is how potentially one for dioxin would impact the drinking water not how it impacts just sort of the the water in general
so that is my caveat
so the groundwater in in our birth is contaminated with one for dioxane
so this is just a map of the plume you can see sort of heres the area where we know that there
theres one for dioxane in the groundwater and for example heres west park i believe so just to give you some orientation of where this is
so as you might remember so we get our water up here from barton pond and then way far south from the airport so this plume doesnt actually impact either of our water sources yet
um so one of the things that people are looking at is theres this little
little bump here and it seems like potentially this little bump is growing and that the plume is actually migrating north so if we zoom out
what were looking at is this right here
so theres some fear that this little knob means that the plume is migrating north and well hit the river up here sort of upstream of where we take our water so
so that is the fear with drinking water the thing about groundwater is that it moves really slowly so the best estimate is that it would be at least years before the plume would hit the river
and we just dont have enough data to know if this is actually happening
but the great thing is that the water treatment plant is actually really well positioned to be able to handle it so even just with our current treatment process weve done tests and we can remove up to about to of anyone for dioxane thats in
the water just because of our existing ozone disinfection
but if we wanted to increase our treatment we could do uv hydrogen peroxide or hydrogen peroxide and ozone and that would give us levels of removal in the range so we have
for us to alter our treatment process to deal with it but again this isnt a decision were going to have to make
even in the course of you know one year or five years its a very long term decision and will have a lot of advanced warning
so our treatment plant was built in and we are still actually using a lot of that infrastructure
its sort of past its useful life and were looking to about million dollar project to upgrade part of our treatment plans and in that upgrade
we would expect that that needs to be used for the next to to years and so as we go into that project we will definitely be looking at what what would happen if we had to treat for one for docs thing
so now well move into p fos i dont know if youve heard about p bass but they have been in the news a lot
ppfas stands for per employee floral alcohol substances and this is a family of over compounds
so its a we dont actually know even what all of these are because a lot of them are trade secrets we just know that theyre compounds that have floridians carbon buttons
and the reason that theres so many of these and theyre used in a lot of products is that they have really great chemical properties theyre theyre sort of resistant to oil and resistant to water so theyre used in nonstick cookware theyre using
stain resistant water resistant textiles a lot of food wrappers are coated in p fast so that the oil doesnt leak through
and then theyre also using a lot of industrial application so firefighting foam metal plating and other processes so even in some dental floss just you know it glides really well its probably got p fos on it honestly
but the reason that were concerned about these is that these are their stable and they dont degrade the carbon florian bond is really one of the strongest bond that exists which is part of the reason that these are great to us
but basically once they get out they they dont go anywhere they just keep on cycling through the environment and their bio a cumulative so once theyre invested
they have a very long half life in your body
and were still this is an active area of research were still learning about health impacts but some of the ones that have been studied for the longest we know may have may interfere with hormone function
they might cause your cholesterol to increase they will increase certain types of cancer risks and they will likely impact your immune system so these are compounds that we are concerned about
luckily in ann arbor
right now the filtration with carbon is the best way to remove these p foss compounds from water and weve been using jz filtration since so even before we knew that this was an issue weve been using the best available technology to remove them
just sort of by happenstance
and just a note different types of carbon absorb chemicals at different rates so thats one thing that has been very important for us is that were looking at what is the best type of carbon to us in our filters so that we can remove p for the best
so if we look at the history we actually didnt know that we had p fos in the water until
and that was the first time we detected it
finally in we identified the huron river as a source and thats actually kind of unexpected most p fox contamination is normally associated with groundwater
so because we had wells on an airport where potentially they could have been using firefighting foam we sort of thought that was a likely culprit but it turns out it was the huron river
so as we were talking with our carbon vendor we have been testing new different types of carbon weve been really aggressively changing out our filters
and weve been doing active research so were really addressing p fos very actively and one of the things to note is that actually just this summer michigan published limits for these compounds so we now have seven different drinking water limits for
seven different compounds and ill show you those in a second
so what does rp foss and people at data look like so people some people are the two compounds that have been studied the most in terms of p fast and they also tend to have the
maybe some of the worst health impacts theyre the most bio a cumulative and so you can see that their limits are in the eight to parts per trillion rain and apart petroleum is one drop in an olympic sized swimming pool so were talking very small
concentrations
and what you can see the blue is the cure on river and the orange is the drinking water
and so you can see that certainly the concentration fluctuate in the river which is one of the reasons that have having the river be the source of ps actually makes this more complicated because we dont
on any given day we dont necessarily know what the concentration is it can vary depending on what our sources are doing upstream
but you can see that sort of in this time range we were really actively addressing our the type of carbon in our filters and increasing the amount that we change out and weve basically gone to non detects in the drinking water for these two compounds
so the strategy that were using is working really well for these two
and i mentioned that the
well yeah and i mentioned that the that the state of michigan has limits for seven of these compounds im just showing
these are the seven compounds
and these are the concentrations that we currently have in our drinking water so even the two that we do detect for orders of magnitude below what the limit is one thing that im sure youll note is that some of these have limits of six and some of these
have limits of so that really has everything to do with the likelihood that these compounds will bio accumulate so this this compound thats called pfhxa
it really doesnt bio accumulates so when you ingest it it sort of goes through you a lot faster than this one here that pfna which has a much longer halfway so thats why you have sort of this this wide array of maximum contaminant limit but um
with that bit of information one of the things that the state of michigan has asked us to do is to measure
basically to of these p foss compounds that we have known standards for so we were measuring basically everything that we can
and then we add those numbers all together
so i guess based on what i just told you that i could have parts per trillion of one compound and it would be basically the same amount of risk as six parts per trillion of a different compounds adding all these numbers together doesnt actually
tell you that much because you dont know if you have parts per trillion of this compound you would be really worried but if you have parts per trillion of this compound
you know youre youre not really in a risk level
so but this is one of the things that we have been looking at as well so this total p fos number
in the past companies were using these compounds like pfosmpfoa which are longer chain carbons and theyre actually easier to remove from water
now pls a pfa are basically outlawed or theyre illegal to use in some contexts
so now theyve been switching to shorter carbon chain links and these are actually much harder to remove and so
were currently doing actually after research to figure out how we can remove those shorter chain compounds luckily theyre not as bio cumulative so the health impacts are not going to be as great
um but obviously we want to do the best weekend to protect public health and so were working on optimizing our treatment so this is actually a master student but ive had working with me for the past year and a half and shes been looking at different
types of carbon were also experimenting with ion exchange
to see if maybe we need another technology to better remove p foss but really i think one of the most important things that we continue to work on is
we know most of the sources for these compounds in our watershed and in fact theres one primary source which is a metal player that that discharges through an industrial pretreatment permit to wastewater treatment plant wastewater treatment processes
are not meant to remove p fox and so that just come straight down the river
so we have been working very hard to advocate
it is much easier to treat a concentrated stream of waste in a smaller volume than it is to treat sort of dilute contaminants at a million gallon per day scale
so i just want to take a step back actually from drinking water and say in the city of ann arbor were very committed to holistically dealing with issues
so we havent just said oh look we have the drinking water and were figuring that out weve also been looking at the here on river which has which is where the cost is coming from
weve been looking at wastewater because one of the primary sources of our wastewater is the drinking water so we know that that p foss is you know moving through the state of michigan has been doing a lot of work on p fos and fish and foam and weve
been cooperating with them on that and then firefighting phone which is one of the big sources of p bass contamination sort of in the world
and one of our i guess proudest stories is that we really proactively reached out to our fire department and talked with them and help them to identify a type of form that doesnt actually have fluorine in it
and so before really anything happened at the state level our fire department had already switched to this flooring free foam and they manifest they sent all of their flooring containing foam off as hazardous waste
we also worked with in our watersheds to talk with other fire departments to talk with them about why fluorine and firefighting phones is problematic and that they could switch and weve done our job pretty well educating wise
and so now there have been several instances where theres been a car fire where they need to use theoretically they need to use this type of phone and theyve contacted other fire departments are contacting our fire department to ask us to use our
phone on the fire because theres a chance that the water will end up in here on river so weve really been were not just sort of saying weve fixed to the drinking water were okay were really focused on holistically dealing with this and the
way that were doing that is through a lot of advocacy and outreach so were reaching out to our customers were educating our employees
were also working within our water said weve done a lot of work with the state we were actually heavily involved in developing the mcs for the state of michigan
this is the water treatment plant manager and he testified in front of a committee about p fos and weve also been doing a lot of outreach with the media so sort of taking a step back from science a little bit its important to have really good science
and data but also if you cant communicate your your message you you may as well not have all of your science and data because in the end we need our customers to support us and we we want people to feel good about drinking the water that weve spent
all of this work making so this is the team that i work with every day
we staff the water treatment plant
and were responsible for all of the operations and maintenance of this million gallon per day facility so its a lot of work but
every person who who does it does it because they like contributing to the community so with that ill put up my contact information if you ever do have water quality questions
i will be the one that youll end up talking with anyway so please feel free to reach out and then i dont know if we are taking questions or whats next but im done with my part
live folks at ritual folks
a lot of like bottled water theyll drink from that and i actually know about this whole process and you know we live on campus just like curious if you know anything that doesnt do anything
thats what im curious
well yes okay so the british filter removes all of the chlorine residual and it grows bacteria so you have a biologically active filter on your counter that youre using
and any water thats coming out of it doesnt have a disinfectant residual so
i actually had ive run into some houses where they decided that they wanted a whole house filter and then were really upset that there was a lot of like bacteria growing everywhere because turns out when you when the water is not disinfected it bacteria
will grow thats just the way it goes so im honestly removing of chemicals and the filter is likely not any better than the industrial size filter that we use on a daily basis of the water treatment plant
however i will say that though the one time that i do recommend people use household filters as if theyre concerned about lead in their plumbing so this would be a banner has removed really all of the lead
like in front of the houses but even up until household fixtures could have a certain percentage of lead in them and we very tightly control our chemistry
to minimize any sort of lead coming out and all of the data shows that were doing a good job but for sure in some of these old houses theres lead solder theres lead lead foster i mean lead and faucets and so if thats if thats a concern but you
do have to buy them a filter that is certified to remove lead and a lot of these just normal breath
for this act because you need the water takes a lot a long time to dream through the filters that remove lead so
i mean bottled water is pretty expensive and also is not actually regulated or tested as much as drinking water im not saying that its not safe im just saying that like it has
it hasnt environmental impact and monetary fiscal impact
theres also some concern about the amount of micro plastics that when you open a bottle youre making micro plastics we dont know the health impacts of micro plastics but just that is
yeah
hi um first off thank you guys so much for coming both your presentations are really interesting
and one question and the older pipes that we used to use you had mentioned how they were older and thicker and theyre made of a better quality so they tend to last longer um do we purposely build with less quality materials
now in hopes of like more regular updating of our pipes or is there like a cost associated with using less quality pipes now are we losing or making money off of that system
so what i understand your question is are the pipes were using less of less quality manufacturing processes have changed over years so its not necessarily that were looking at a lesser quality because the pipes are still doing their job
what were running into is these pipes that were put in over years ago maybe were just have a thicker wall and they just last longer theyre still providing the service that theyre required for theyre still distributing theyre still conveying
its just the management type is a little bit different now because theyre all of these different thicknesses of pipes in the ground i would not say there are lesser quality i just say i would just say they have a shorter life span
and when we think about designing an infrastructure that has to last for years we look at maximizing that lifespan for a cost benefit analysis
thank you
can i ask one more question sorry
um so you had mentioned imperviousness and how it was um i mean my understanding is just that it means to not allow water to flow can you explain what you meant by that in the context of the citys watershed
does that mean we have a lot of stagnant water for that like part isnt necessarily allowing or not allowing water to flow imperviousness is allowing water to infiltrate back into the ground
so if you think about a lawn versus a parking lot of parking lots going to be impervious its rock hard water is not going to soak into it back into the groundwater recharging our groundwater resources whereas a lawn
if it rains a lot but probably be a little bit of runoff but a majority of the water on a lawn is going to soak in so it is previous for rainfall
does that help the yeah thank you
i got a question for you jen which was you know one of the things we hear about climate change is like heavier rain halls like more concentrated and im wondering like how that how that change in precipitation patterns impacting planning around some
of the storm water systems that the city is using budget can i hear you speaking over there so
good
its actually really good question and i mentioned in the beginning of my discussion that ann arbor as a leader in the great lakes region when it comes to stormwater management
because of our relationship with the university of michigan and lisa and the great lakes research facilities weve been kind of ahead of the game looking at how to adapt our practices for climate mitigation
so we recognize that there are larger rain events that are coming more frequently of a larger intensity but potentially a shorter duration to you guys
maybe if you start looking at i actually have an entire presentation on climate adaptation and stormwater management
um its really interesting because we with the research facilities that we have weve been able to look at how rainfall has changed in the last hundred years specific to the ann arbor region which is really good because its essentially a micro point
of data as opposed to all of michigan or all of the great lakes region because as i mentioned rainfall falls differently in different places
what we have been seeing is more rain quicker but maybe not as often so were having to design our systems to hold more water but not for a really long time because its going to infiltrate back into the soil or enter into our storm water system at
a slower rate we dont want to overwhelm our systems so its not always building a bigger pipe its building storage and weve incorporated those design parameters and criteria into our stormwater standards
so when a developer comes in and designs a new stormwater management system or when we build a new road and put in a new storm water pipe we are designing to mitigate or adapt our practices to mitigate and address the more intense storms
for that shorter duration so its kind of built into the engineering behind the scenes its not an in your face were not doing anything drastically visibly different
its just that weve changed the philosophy of how we manage stormwater and we dont build a bigger pipe and push it to our neighbors downstream because thats not only the not thats not the right thing to do
its not a nice thing to do but we recognize that treating storm water where it falls is the most beneficial for the environment and most beneficial for the community as well as the water quality in there in the community
good question
i can share my presentation if you like
lot of sort of environments
lockdown and whatnot im wondering if you all have any data like im just curious personally how did this summer go i know it was really hot and dry and you see like a notable uptick in use
i know theres a lot of variables there but i was just wondering if people are targeting phenomenon
like watering
im going to answer that question a few different ways because i have my ann arbor hat on i dont live in town i actually live near detroit the use over there was very different
ann arbor the community if you think about who lives here theres a large population on campus
so our water use as a hole in the city of an arbor dropped because there were no students there was no university there was no research there was no faculty labs working
so overall the water use went down
but if you flip it and just focus on residential we saw at least from erin irrigation standpoint we saw an uptick and people arent taking more showers i mean hopefully theyre still taking a shower at home i dont know maybe they took lesser i
dont know but did you guys see anything at the plant specifically for the
yeah so i guess we just overall weve seen a decrease in demand and thats still continuing today and part of that is offices are still not open
so theres a lot of businesses downtown and office parks around the area and theyre not using water schools are closed so their husband actually some interesting water quality related things that weve seen so normally
there are so for example up by skyline high school theres skyline normally pulls a lot of water and theres some neighborhoods up there where their water is getting older basically and theyre having maybe
like if the water gets really old it starts having a little bit of a smell and weve just seen more of that this year then maybe we have in previous years next to these schools where the neighborhood is normally a flow through to the school and without
the school pulling water theres problems we were also fairly concerned about building water quality
luckily not like well in in our reviews a disinfectant thats actually really good for water being stagnant it last longer and also come back to a specific type of pathogen that likes to grow and stuff stagnant water is called legionella
and so thats one of the things that other cities were fairly concerned about is all these buildings that were shut out for three months no are used and then people come back into them and the plumbing
theres maybe back in the plumbing so actually very proactively reached out to businesses so what we ended up doing was
i ran water like water consumption numbers from last spring and this spring and then i calculated i pulled out all of the businesses that were using or like or less percent of the water from the same time last year so places that had had greater
than a decrease in the water consumption that that they had
and there were about probably businesses where they actually use you know they use zero water and so we sent them basically a letter saying hey before you open up your building
heres some ideas for what you want to do to make sure that water is is safe im particularly for schools and childcare facilities its really important
so i guess maybe thats not so much a youth
but there there were definitely things with kogan that that have made us manage water differently
were doing right now but do you have any like changes and how your
you all function contingency with our other operating so actually theres normally a valve that we have to open to make sure that we get enough water to the stadium
and were definitely not opening that one this year because theres without the crowd theres not going to be enough water use
the questions
i have a question as much as i am really glad you both touched on the public engagement issue
just because i think sarah is kind of alluded to this is like theres often think about the logistics and some of the science in terms of managing the systems and and thats certainly super important but you know the example of the fact that you all
you all have to communicate with with the public with elected officials with people who may not necessarily know anything about how the system operates
and so just to be able to do that in a way that people can understand and make sense of and be able to better appreciate what goes into the whole process
i just think that that was a great thing to emphasize and probably not one that a lot of people working in the positions that you have get a lot of experience with before you start that right after the fact
totally so i worked for local government for over years and one way or another and ann arbor is the definitely the most engaged community i have ever worked with
i worked with the community in oakland county i worked as a consultant for many oakland county communities doing the same kind of work and if we had a public meeting about a project maybe one person would show up
maybe and usually it was somebody who lived right on the project and they wanted to make sure that the playground wasnt destroyed even though we werent touching the playground we were working on the road in front of our house in in our we just had
actually last thursday were building a regional detention pond over near silo church and i we had people show up for a an outdoor field walk just to let just to see where the pond was going to go
thats incredible and when i tell my cohorts and other communities theyre astounded by that
but what i think its not just this community reacting its that i also think we push a lot of information out we are very informative were very proactive and in transparency almost what is it that were doing why are we doing it
whats the science and data behind it this is why were doing it and if you have more questions we want to talk to you about it
so its more of a an alliance or an allegiance rather than this is government doing what we say we want to do
a good time to work in government
thats good to hear
coming in a little bit asking about what was the day to day was like on the year well so um i came here
ill get to the tilly do but i came here im actually thinking i was going to continue my work in the arctic but then we got this grant to work on lake erie
so i didnt realize it until the first week but it turns out i get viciously seasick
so i spent you know eight or nine hours a day on a boat im taking so um i was working with noah and global and we were out on this little old coast guard boat we get up super early drive down to toledo
i wouldnt drive because i would already be taking my motion sickness medication that made me kind of groggy but anyways this is maybe this is personal to me obviously other people did feel work and had a great experience
but we had i think nine or monitoring points around the basin
and we would go to each of those points and there were probably five different groups that were working on this and so each of them would have like a different parameter that they would be measuring they would lower songs
i was taking water from different depths using like a pair of celtic pump and a tube and then i would take all of that water down below deck and i would be mad i was measuring hydrogen peroxide so i did a lot of very like high petting micro leader
eloqua into small test tubes and for texting them which is really hard to do when youre seasick im just going to say it
so
so the interesting thing about the bloom on lake erie is that it goes through this really interesting life cycle and they would sort of describe it based on what kind of soup
it looked like that day so does it look like egg drop soup or does it look like split pea soup or are we to like jello or you know and it definitely got to line jello that year
so i do remember i was we we had one of our designated weekly field days that when the toledo water intake was shut down and i remember driving down that morning and all of the cars sort of going were like trucks pickup trucks that had a bunch
bottled water in in the back of their truck because
that was just there was a sort of a watershed moment for me but also it talks it goes back to this whole thing about public engagement
and basically two years later they went back two or three years later they went back and most citizens and deleted still didnt feel comfortable drinking their water
because of this like one moment where they werent quite prepared enough and they had to issue this dont drink the water advisory and so i think for me thats a really that has been something that i have taken to heart because you dont get
you basically get one shot and if you if you mess it up it takes years and years and years to rebuild public trust and so that sort of deviated from the question about lake erie but but basically we would be out on the boat taking samples and then bring
them back to the lab and spend the rest of the week processing them
and it really was an awesome experience and great to work with so many different
i mean it was a very interdisciplinary project
the
ad networks
you know if theres ever a time when you guys have
so theres two distinct systems that are storm water drinking water
the storm water system collects the runoff from the university properties and sometimes it discharges to city stormwater sometimes it discharges directly to a county dream and sometimes it discharges directly to waters of the state
so here on river
each of those different discharge points have a different set of rules
im saying that because it its not one big
the university have whats called an ms for permit from the state actually comes from the federal stormwater regulations but its a permit that allows that entity to discharge stormwater ms for stands for municipal separate storm sewer system i had
to do that wants to make sure i have all the assets
but we caught our ms for permit the city and the university both partner because its the same community that we all have to work within they just have regulation or jurisdiction over their discharge points we have regulation over our discharge points
so thats kind of thats one example that i want to give you that theres this really great partnership and its its stormwater its rain water
theres flooding on campus theres flooding in this city city streets run through campus so theres a little bit of a mix but at the end of the day the ultimate discharge point for all of us as the here on river and we recognize that
so thats the stormwater one the drinking water ones a little bit different because we make the water at the city
we distribute the water to our customers but on the university campus there are distribution lines that are connected to ours but then a distributed distribute that
additionally so there are hydrants that are used are owned by the university on their own theres distribution lines that are on their own or actually working right now with the university on a kind of a maintenance agreement because they actually
were actually working right now with the university on a kind of a maintenance agreement because they actually have their own crews for both of these systems to go out and work on them i told you guys we only have four guys on our storm water
i think they have three guys working on their storm water
its the same kind of work its not duplicative because we have our own pipes we have to manage they have their own pipes we have to manage
but there definitely is a partnership with the drinking water its a little bit of a different regulatory agency though because we both have to answer to the state
at the end of the day theyre permitted through the state or federal permitted through the state for water distribution our permits are a little bit different because we also make the water not just distribute it but their system at the university
level still deals with different buildings different research labs
parking if im wrong dont they have their own treatment for in addition for some of the labs for hot water loop so they dont theyre not permitted as a like a secondary truth
correct
does that answer your question though its messy but it works really well because we have a lot of collaboration between the city and the university
time well have more questions i can probably stick around
for five minutes otherwise please give us a hand
climate education thing is weve actually been working a lot with research stuff here at the university
i would love to do more
and if theres more on the research and anything else were already doing the things were already doing what we know we need to do to address major needs which is nice and balanced beyond so many other municipalities just being the science person
that i am i want to be more like lets keep working on what if i have somebody from the washington county health department of my other class and i get a very similar message from her which is like you know youre doing like times more than most communities
communities but i still dont have so many more things that i really like to be doing
and i think this is like a good example yeah
no
definitely sarah obviously our recent in her career but when you start doing work in public service
it takes a special kind of person to want to work for public service because youre doing everything you can but then the science part of us that know what we could do research we could do this
and then youre like oh wait thats not what were supposed to do because we have our main goal of making sure people get clean water that thats what the rates pay for thats where the bills are paid on hand to find out so those partnerships come
in they come in
if there were any you know researchers on
if the university wasnt here i think a lot of our research opportunities happen we wouldnt have a lot of the push the innovation because we
when i
think theres very theres a lot of jealousy of what you guys have universe in your backyard you have a we have a we have last two but we kind of push each other university pushes us we push the university
yeah
well again i appreciate you
